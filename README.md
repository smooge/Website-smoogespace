# Websites SmoogeSpace

## General Notes

A project to cover the setup and running of the general SmoogeSpace
websites. There are 3 basic websites to be covered.

* funct-smoogespace.  This is the current website (2022-02-27) showcased
  at https://www.smoogespace.com. It was written in 1999 when I was
  working for Red Hat as a technical support manager. Its main goal was
  to be a place to teach myself HTML 4.0 over the HTML 2.0 I had learned
  at Spyglass. It was also to showcase family stories about various
  Smoogen's I knew and learned of. After finding pictures being reused
  without attribution, I removed them and then used the site mainly to
  house files I needed to get work done elsewhere. Once I have decided
  on a new website, this tree will move to 'defunct-smoogespace'.
  
* next-smoogespace. This will be the next generation website using a
  static website generator and a markdown backend. The goals of this
  site will be to take over the blogging currently done on
  https://smoogespace.blogger.com and to be a 'resume' stuffer to point
  to work either on the site or in other places on the internet
  (github/gitlab/pagure/etc).

* xenadu. Xenadu is an 'internal' server used for housing virtual
  machines and doing basic builds of packages. The web-pages here are
  basic and to be called from ansible in the ansible-smoogespace
  project.
