Like all pages circa 1995, this page was constantly under construction.

<P>
  The main purpose of this and other pages in the 'historical' git is to
  cover how the SmoogeSpace website morphed from 1995 from LANL.gov to
  Shout.net to Roadkill.net to Smoogespace.com. The original pages
  contained a lot of personal information about family histories,
  school, life, etc which I have removed. Mainly because if it is a
  'secondary question' that a Bank or Hospital asks to confirm your
  identity.. it was listed here.
</P>
<p>
  The main point of this made up history is mainly to cover the way I
  wrote pages over time versus what I put in the pages. Wayback machine
  probably has all that already anyway.
</p>
<p>At this point in time I was using emacs for everything from email to
  writing TeX pages and all the web pages were using a special mode for
  HTML which is no longer valid. It was nice in that it kept the
  timestamp at the bottom of the page to whenever the page was last
  edited.
