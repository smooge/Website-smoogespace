    <p>
      Hi there, and thanks for dropping by our website. Like most vanity
      web-sites, it has info on various members of the family, friends,
      and other people. The Smoogen family is a small set of people
      (probably only 30 or so in the US.. and doubtful anywhere else in
      the world as Ellis Island gave us the name in the first place.)
    </p>

    <p>
      The main focus at the moment of this site is currently myself,
      Stephen John Smoogen... 
    </p>
    <p>
      In the mean time, I hope something here interests you and helps
      you somehow.

	Currently, I am pursuing a fascinating career in
	house-husbandry. I am working on cleaning diapers, house, and
	working on small consulting jobs on the side. I have enjoyed
	working at Red Hat for the last 4 years, but decided that
	spending time with Paul was a once in a lifetime opportunity.
