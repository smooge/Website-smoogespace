Like all pages circa 1995, this page was constantly under construction.

<h2 align=center>A Word From the Author</h2>

<p> A blank slate is always terrifying for me to write on.

<p>What do I say that you haven't seen on a thousand other web
pages... what should I write to catch your interest above a billion other
pages all vieing for your 20 seconds before you press the right arrow to go
back from whatever search led you here.

<p> The answer is nothing. I could put this page with a thousand naked
images, whirling graphical images, or exciting java applets and you would
just pass this page like so many others.

<p>So in the end, I have to face the cold hard fact that my primary
audience is myself. So with that in mind, bare with me while I try to find
that being who I am contemplating.

<p> Anyway, I no longer have a blank slate, and can get back to work.

<h2 align=center>Table of Contents</h2>

<p> Here is where I give you a quick rundown of what I have here at
SmoogeSpace. 

<dl>
  <dt><a href="about.html">About This Site</a>
  <dd>Why is it called SmoogeSpace, etc, etc.

  <dt><a href="whoami.html">A Little About Me</a>
  <dd>A quick run down of my life. Pretty boring stuff. 

  <dt><a href="gaming.html">Gaming</a>
  <dd>What I do in my copious amount of spare time. If any section gets
      regular updating, this area will.

  <dt><a href="http://www.redhat.com">Where I Work</a>
  <dd>What pays for my copious amount of spare time. Please don't mind the
      slow download. We have a LOT of people accessing those pages, and I
      think the poor PHTML is overloaded.
      
  <dt><a href="bookmarks.html">Red Baron and Netscape Bookmarks</a>
  <dd>This was added because I am no longer using Spyglass Red Baron and
  needed to keep my bookmarks available. I had a bunch from Netscape
  also so combined into that format.
</dl>

Thanks for your time... and good luck on wherever you go next.
