<P>And this section is deleted because it covered everything down to my
blood type in history. Geeeez.</P>

<p align=center><b>Notes</b></p>

<hr>

<p align=center><it><a name="payscales">Pay scales:</a></it></p>

<p>I have always been of the opinion that we do not pay enough to the people
who matter the most to our society. These are usually people who work for
tax dollars, and get the shaft because no one wants to raise taxes if
needed. To misquote someone I heard long ago, you get the society you pay
for.

<it>Jobs that deserve respect and better pay<it>

<dl>
  <dt>Teachers
  <dd>While we all see cases of teachers who shouldnt teach... I think
      that if you look hard enough you will find people in whatever your
      position is. These people are teaching the future of our
      society, and usually work a hell of a lot of hours in doing so. (All
      the teachers I have ever met do 12-14 hour days in preparing classes,
      dealing with troublesome students, and grading homework.) If we want
      a better world, these people are at least one third of the answer.

  <dt>Military Personnel
  <dd>These people put there lives on the line for the freedoms that you
      and I take for granted every day. They may be sent to places that we
      would never want to go, and do things we would never want to do
      because it is in our countries interests.

  <dt>Public Peace Officers (Police and Fire)
  <dd>Again people who do a job that most of us are afraid to do. While
      this is a difficult job, it is a two way street. Every officer "on
      the beat" need the respect of the community to do their job, but they
      also need to make sure they deserve that respect. 
</dl>

<p>There are a lot of discussions from people who feel that one side or
  another already get paid too much. In the end, I think each of these
  people have a very tough job, and need as much respect and help as the
  other.</P>

<p align=center><it><a name="bigotry">Bigotry</a></it>

<p>Bigotry is an ugly disease that I think we are all inflicted with in
  some way or another. Of all the diseases I have ever had it is the one
  that I am most sick of. We fear, get angry, and hate each other for
  things that are so small in differences that they are truly un
  remarkable. I think I read somewhere that the genetic differences
  between a black person and a white person are 6 genes... and those
  genes are so varied in between white populations and black populations
  that you can't call them markers of superiority, inferiority, or any
  of the other buzzwords I heard growing up in this country (both North
  and South of the Mason Dixon line).</p>

<p>In the end, we are all afraid of change and differences probably at
  some instinctual level. However, we are more afraid of admitting that
  we have these fears than trying to get past them... so we lie, we
  enslave, we kill, and we make up excuses that bring out all the
  ugliness that is human.</p>

<p>If you think I am laying on judgement on other people... think
  again. Most of those words have been directed at myself. I have
  thought unkind thoughts, spoken things I now wish I could wash out
  with lye, and been a royal bigot just like the rest of us in our own
  ways...</p>

<p>In the end, I just have to spend every day like the alcoholic working it
out and trying to not make the mistakes I made before. </p>
