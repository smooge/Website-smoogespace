      The Truth Behind Red Hat Names
    </h1>

    <p>
      One of the great <b>Red Hat Secrets</b> is what is behind the
      names of the Red Hat releases. Here is what I have acertained from
      years of snooting around.
    </p>

    <dl>
      <dt>
	First off how does Red Hat come up with each name?
      </dt>
      <dd>
	The rumour is that the names are always chosen on or close to
	the going gold day. Since 1998, Erik Troan has gone around on
	that day and asked for input from various people. The ideas have
	to be related to the last release. In the end Erik tries to come
	up with a name so that he wont be able come up with a matching
	one the next time. The reasoning being that he can stop being
	the person naming the releases at that time. It has yet to 
	happen.
      </dd>
      
      <dt>
	What are the names and what are their relation to each other?

		This is the first of the cross architecture
		releases. Red Hat was working on getting both the Intel
		and Alpha's ready for release. The upgrade from 2.0 to
		2.1 was buggy but better than Slackware's at the time. I
		helped port a browser (Spyglass RedBaron) to the
		platform.

		    Rumour has it that it was 3.0.3 because Slackware

		    in competition.
		  </li>
		  <li>
		    RPM is rewritten in C (reason for major number
		    upgrade). There are also changes in layout.

		    This release marks big changes in Linux that Red

		    Hat was one of the first to use glibc 2.0 for the
		    library versus the glibc 1.x (libc5.2) that other
		    releases were using. This was the reasoning for a

		The Apollo project has been cited as the first sign that

		unable to reach the moon without a major impact on their
		economy. [It has also been said that Manhatten and
		Apollo are both theatres, but the Cold War analogy was
		what I gave when I offered the name.] Apollo is also the
