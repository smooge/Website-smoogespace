      The Truth Behind Red Hat/Fedora Names
    </h1>

    <p>
      One of the great <b>Red Hat Secrets</b> is what is behind the
      names of the Red Hat releases. Here is what I have acertained from
      years of snooting around.
    </p>

    <p><b>Update 2003/07/21:</b> Been away from Red Hat for a bit doing
    other things.. I am updating things as best I can.
    </p>


    <p><b>Update 2006/06/19:</b> Adding in data on Fedora Release names
    and dates. The info on what is occuring behind the releases will not
    be possible. Dates are being updated to co-incide with exacting data
    researched by <a
    href="http://www.owlriver.com/redhat_versions.html">Owl River
    Version Names</a>.
    </p>

    <dl>
      <dt>
	First off how does Red Hat come up with each name?
      </dt>
      <dd>
	The rumour is that the names are always chosen on or close to
	the going gold day. From 1998 til the time Erik Troan left Red
	Hat development (2000?), Erik has gone around on that day and
	asked for input from various people. The ideas have to be
	related to the last release. In the end Erik tries to come up
	with a name so that he wont be able come up with a matching one
	the next time. The reasoning being that he can stop being the
	person naming the releases at that time. It has yet to happen.
	<br/>
	After Erik left development, the trend was continued by various
	lead developers.
      </dd>
      
      <dt>
	What are the names for each Red Hat Linux release and what are
	their relation to each other?

		This is the first of the cross architecture

		and Alpha's ready for release. The upgrade from 2.0 to
		2.1 was buggy but better than Slackware's at the time. I
		helped port a browser (Spyglass RedBaron) to the

		    This Beta release marked the beginning of a new
		    naming scheme.  Erik Troan had moved onto getting a
		    doctorate in Economics. I had moved onto being a
		    house-daddy.. so I dont have all the clues I used
		    to.
		  </li>
		  <li>
		    Changes in this beta was that that GRUB replaces
		    LILO, XFree86-4.1 replaces more of the older
		    XFree86-3.3.6 systems, and ext3 is brought in as a
		    Journal.

		    Roswell is a pretty town in New Mexico, USA. Actress
		    Demi Moore is from around there. After World War II,
		    a 'weather balloon' was lost in the Roswell area and
		    UFO watchers believe covered up. There is also a
		    show on Fox called Roswell about way-to-pretty teenagers
		    who have to cope with being aliens. [The show moved
		    to another channel later.. but I dont watch TV
		    anymore so I dont know what.]

		    The Enigma release has a very solid installer and
		    upgrade path. The GNOME desktop uses Nautilus, the
		    KDE is 2.2, and the kernel is 2.4.7 with lots of
		    patches. During the release there were <a
		    href="ftp://ftp.redhat.com/pub/redhat/linux/updates/7.1/en/os/">updates</a>
		    to the kernel and glibc which cleaned up some late

		    Enigma means a puzzle. It was used as a code word

		    The Skipjack Beta seems to have been one that
		    almost wasnt. Looking at how Red Hat's Rawhide was
		    moving up until the Beta, they were using gcc-3.0
		    for the compiler, python2, gtk2.0 and other
		    nifty-neat tools. This gave the impression that the
		    next release was going to be an 8.0 versus
		    7.3.. <br>

		    However when Skipjack was released, it turned
		    out to be more of a gradual update. Gone was the
		    gcc-3.0 and reliance on python2/gtk2.x
		    tools. KDE3.0cvs was in there.. but otherwise it was
		    pretty much a maturing of the 7.x series.<br>

		    Getting the inside scoop was a lot harder now that I
		    wasnt an employee.. but it would seem that there
		    were too many problems with the gcc-3.0 c++
		    compiler. It was very standard compliant, but most
		    of the c++ code out there wasnt. It was increasingly
		    turning into patch other peoples code over and
		    over... The gcc-3.1 code looked
		    to be a fix on this but wasnt going to be released
		    in time. Again this I got from sources who may or
		    may not have been pulling my leg.
		  </li>
		  <li>
		    Skipjack is another encryption algorithm. It was
		    originally going to be used in the government
		    clipper chip (a thankfully failed initiative to have
		    special govt encryption in all devices that could be
		    listened to by them with court order.) Like Enigma,
		    it was shown that the Skipjack algorithm was easily
		    broken with brute force methods.

		    The 7.3 release came out in early May with little

		    Ok here is the dime store version of Norse
		    mythology... it is MUCH deeper than this. Valhalla
		    is the warriors paradise in Norse legends. The Norse
		    believed that those who died in combat would ascend
		    to Asgard and live out time fighting all day and
		    carousing in the halls of Valhalla every night. 

		    <br> Possible links between Valhalla and Skipjack
		    are that

		      <li>
			they are islands.

		    The limbo release saw Red Hat returning to using
		    GCC-3.1 and a glibc version numbered near 2.3. This
		    led to lots of speculation that the next release
		    would be 8.0. Other software that was added or
		    updated was OpenOffice-1.0, GNOME-2, KDE-3.0.2, and
		    various other tidbits.
		    <br>
		    Other big changes in this release was the beginning
		    of what could be called the Red Hat Desktop. In an
		    effort to unify the look and feel of KDE and GNOME
		    by using the same icons for applications and giving
		    the new user a limited number of applications on the
		    base menu so as to not 'confuse' things with 30 ways
		    to do email (all of them different.)
		    <br>
		    In an experiment that didnt extend to later betas,
		    the first cd set was based off of 700 mb ISO images
		    versus 650. This was to try and keep as many
		    packages as possible from the existing base. Sadly,
		    too many cdroms had problems writing, booting, or
		    reading the 700mb and packages had to be dropped.

		    Limbo has several definitions:
		    <ul>
		      <li>
			A dance where people try to scurry under a
			lowered bar without falling onto the
			ground. Much fun even if not drunk.
		      </li>
		      <li>
			The place between heaven and hell where
			unbaptized but innocent or righteous await
			the end of the universe in Roman Catholic
			theology.
		      </li>
		    </ul>
		    This second definition would then be the link to
		    Valhalla.

		    Null was the last beta released for the 7.3.x
		    cycle. Major changes were the removal of packages
		    from the usual distribution, upgrading the compiler
		    suite to GCC-3.2 and further refinements of the Red Hat
		    desktop. The controversy of this finally seemed to
		    make the press finally as KDE people said that Red
		    Hat was killing them, and GNOME people began to
		    wonder if they had a Microsoft in their midst. In
		    other words, the usual hullabaloo about nothing.

		    Null is a state of oblivion. Limbo is a place of

		    Historically this release ended up being a red
		    headed bastard stepchild release. While lots of
		    updates occured from the 7 tree.. the new emphasis
		    on enterprise releases saw less emphasis on the
		    release than in the past. With Red Hat Linux 9
		    coming out in early 2003 with more major
		    changes.. this release faded into obscurity.
		  </li>
		  <li>
		    Updates to GCC, rpm, GNOME, KDE, and the addition of
		    a commonized desktip of KDE and GNOME made this
		    release a major change from the 7.x tree. Many
		    changes to the Desktop were pretty controversial to
		    KDE users as it 'stripped' the differences between
		    the two desktops and made them look the
		    same. Adoption of 8.0 in a lot of shops was delayed
		    for the usual .0 release reasons of waiting for a
		    'stable' 8.1 to come out. 
		  </li>
		  <li>
		    In Greek mythology, Psyche was one of the most
		    beautiful women of the world, and gathered the wrath
		    of Aphrodite because humanity began to adore Psyche
		    more than her. Aphrodite sent her son, Eros to
		    punish Psyche, but to make a long story short, fell
		    in love with her and didnt end her life. Aphrodite
		    turned her son into a large serpent and Psyche was
		    sent by Oracles to become his husband. After much
		    storymaking, Psyche made peace with Aphrodite and
		    the two lovers were united once more.
		  </li>
		  <li>
		    Psyche is a Greek name for butterfly. It is also
		    used in various mystics views as the soul and center
		    of being.

		    The Phoebe release started to show that Red Hat was
		    going to majorly change things. With the addition of
		    threaded libraries and gcc/kernel changes people
		    found that apps compiled on Phoebe didnt run on
		    8.0. There was further cleanup of the desktop making
		    it quite usable for people not familiar with X-Windows.

		    Phoebe was one of the original titans which would be

		    Saturn. There is no known link between this release
		    and Phoebe Cates.
