	      Converting d20 into Torg Terms
	    </h1>
	    <p>
	      Since the number of Torg adventures are few, and getting
	      rather long in the tooth, the adventurous GM's might try
	      converting various d20 adventures into Torg Terms [or vice
	      versa if you really want to.]
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      The attempt to try and do a conversion is always fraught with
	      inaccuracies and error. The attempts to model the real
	      world in RPG's has less to do with converting metric to
	      "English units" and more with converting Escher to Van Gogh.
	      A lot gets lost or gained in the translation. In order to
	      make this translation somewhat believeable (or at least so
	      I don't get tired of writing it before its done.) we will
	      try to work easy to hard. 
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      At first blush, the easiest conversions are the bonus
	      numbers, while trying to convert hit points to torg rules
	      are going to be the hardest.
	    </p>
	    <h2>
	      D20 Generalities.
	    </h2>
	    <p>
	      The d20 owes many of its "real world models" on its
	      heritage from the ChainMail and D&amp;D&reg; games of the
	      1970's. To create probability curves it uses multiple
	      forms and numbers of dice. To model damage and skill
	      advancement it uses hit-points and levels. Even the names
	      of the six attributes and the basic range are the same as
	      they have always been. 
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      However with the 3rd edition of D&amp;D&reg; much of the
	      underpinnings have changed and been updated to rules that
	      have been found useful and popular in other games. The
	      skill and attribute system now uses logs (though it only
	      tells you that in small type deep in the back of the
	      book.) There seems to have been some work to extend this
	      other parts of the game, but either due to the writers
	      running out of time, juice, or just thinking it was too
	      different from original D&amp;D&reg;.. it didn't get
	      done. 
	    </p>
	    <p class="small">
	      On a side note, the current editors and writers of
	      D&amp;D&reg; do seem to listen to what players are saying,
	      and have been making updates for future editions that seem
	      to maintain playability but add new things. Other game
	      authors could take a lesson from this.
	    </p>
	    <h2>
	      Converting Bonus Numbers
	    </h2>
	    <p>
	      Our first task will be to make a general conversion table
	      from D20 attributes to bonus numbers to Torg
	      attributes. Normally this would require a lot of
	      multiplication and division but due to some flukes of
	      nature (and possibly that some of the authors worked on a
	      LOG 100 system before), it is just straight addition.
	    </p>
	    <p class="small">
	      A big help in converting points is that by some sort of
	      co-incidence the maximum bonus number a d20 character can
	      normally have (+5) is equivalent to the difference between
	      the maximum human Torg attribute minus the average
	      (13-8=+5). Using these numbers we can make a first stab of
	      converting d20 to Torg's log attribute system.
	    </p>
