Subject: Germany: A New Cosm

I have two much free time.  Well, here goes . . .

GERMANY --- a pocket cosm of Core Earth
=======================================

I know  what you are all saying  right about  now---``Germany, a cosm?
He  must  be  crazy!''  Well,  the latter  may   be  right, but that's
irrelevant.   After living  here for  five months,  and studying  at a
German  univerity for three of  those months, I have identified enough
things   which lead  me to conclude   that Germany  is  a reality unto
itself.  The easiest was to prove this is to  present the stats, which
I shall now do.


AXIOMS
======

	TECH : 22

	This may be a surprise to many of you who are used to thinking
	that  Germany is  a   somewhat advanced  place, with  numerous
	technical related  firms  and   all that.  However,    it  was
	actually  this Tech axiom that first  clued me in.  Here is my
	major proof---the computer system   here is a pretty  standard
	HP-UX machine, similar to  any number of systems carrying user
	accounts    at similarly sized     universities in the States.
	However, the crash rate, the  frequency of disk problems,  the
	screw-ups  coming down  from the  supposed sysadmins/operators
	are inconsistent with a properly connected (all puns intended)
	Tech 23 computer system.  I give  one specific example which I
	think cements  that the Tech axiom here  is lower  than in the
	US.

	I had two  terminal windows opened on a  Mac  (that's a pretty
	low Tech axiom  to start with :),  one local (machine rzstud1)
	and one with an rlogin to my American account (machine unity).
	I  must have  disconnected  while trying  to think about World
	Peace or something, because I did:

	rzstud1% ftp unity.math.wlu.edu
	ftp: host not found
	ftp>

	This took me  by surprise, and I stared  blankly at the screen
	for a few moments (apparently I used  this time to reconnect).
	I thereupon switched to the other window, did

	unity% ftp rzstud1.rz.uni-karlsruhe.de

	and got a normal connection.  I think that says it all.


	SOCIAL : 21

	This is the same as CE, only to cover the fact that Germany is
	a functioning member (or, at least, no more dysfunctional than
	other  members) of the UN,  the EU, NATO,  and a  more or less
	global   society.    However,   at  the  level    of  personal
	interactions, Social  21  is rarely realised.   See  the World
	Law of Exclusion for additional information.


	MAGIC : 8

	Note that actual  ``magic'' in the  sense of spells is no more
	prevalent in Germany than it is elsewhere in CE.  However, the
	occurence of ``coincidences''   and other halmarks of a  non-0
	magic  reality   are more frequent.   I attribute   this  to a
	self-correcting  feature of the  reality trying to make up for
	the deficiency (with respect to  the rest of  CE) in the  Tech
	axiom.

	For example,  while doing  something stupid like   turning the
	computer   off, whapping the  side  of  it, and then  actually
	getting the  beast   to boot *correctly*   is not  a   regular
	occurence, such  methods do work more  frequently than they do
	in, for example, the U.S.  Such effects, I believe, fall under
	the magic  axiom.  (``Juerg,  how  the hell   did you  get the
	computer to work again?''  ``I don't know.  I just whapped the
	thing.  F*cking magic . . .'')

	Game mechanics  do not seem to  lend themselves easily.  I can
	suggest the following---the Stupid Action.  A Stupid Action is
	a game  term referring to  any action which can essentially be
	described as, ``Of course it's  stupid; I know it won't  work.
	But I'm gonna  do it  anyway.''   Like fixing  the computer by
	kicking it.  I also refer the  reader to the historical record
	which demonstrates a fair amount of success  had by Germany in
	the past by following a stupid, stubborn or bone-headed course
	of action.

	Stupid Actions have a *minimum* difficulty of 25 (``Never Tell
	Me the Odds'')   because they are,  well, Stupid.   This  will
	cover most   Household Stupid Actions.   Truly, *truly* stupid
	things,  like  disarming  the atomic   bomb   by throwing more
	uranium into it,  should use  25  as a base,  and  then the DN
	Modifiers on the DN chart.    For example, Never Tell Me   the
	Odds is  listed as either DN  25, or DN+20 (I  think---I don't
	have the book).  Therefore, a  really bone-headed action would
	have a difficulty   of 25+20=45.  Nigh  on   impossible, as it
	should be.  The player generates a reality total (Ords can use
	base Spirit) against the DN.  

	As an alternative, instead of basing the Stupid Actions off of
	Spirit/Reality, they could  be considered a form of alteration
	magic, in which  case the  Mind  based (Alt. is Mind,  right?)
	Stupidity skill would be   used for the rolls.  The  advantage
	here is that out-of-cosm SKs  could learn to do Stupid Actions
	in other cosms.  The  skill seems particularly appropriate for
	the Nile.


	SPIRIT : 9

	Same   as Core Earth.   No real  differences  here, although I
	suppose one might argue that the Stupid Actions mechanic could
	be assigned to Divine influence instead of a rudimentary magic
	ability.  One could  still use Spirit/Reality, or simply  make
	Stupidity a Spirit based skill.


WORLD LAWS
==========

	LAW OF INCONVENIENCE

	This  is probably the  most  powerful World Law affecting  the
	cosm of Germany.  It affects  all aspects of life.   Generally
	put,  no product or service will   be available in a maximally
	efficient or convenient manner.   For the individual SK,  this
	means  copious amounts of   paperwork to get anything remotely
	official done.  It means that when you  find out that you need
	something, the stores will already be closed.  When you decide
	you absolutely need to  get something down *tomorrow*, someone
	will inform  you that tomorrow is a  state holiday that you've
	never heard of, and that everything  will be closed.  When you
	need   to call your AT&T  access   number, you will get static
	(maybe loud and obnoxious enough to  do a couple result points
	of damage,  too) for three  or four  attempts before getting a
	connection.  After the AT&T  operator  puts you through,   you
	will likely  get arbitrarily disconnected.  (The astute reader
	will  notice that these last  examples are also by-products of
	the Tech axiom.)

	The government passes  laws to encourage Inconvenience.  There
	is  the  infamous ``Ladenschlussgesetz'' or  Store-Closing Law
	which  strictly limits the  opening hours of  just about every
	business.  There is the mandatory  garbage separation.   There
	is the fact  that you can't get a  damned glass of water in  a
	restaurant without being charged  3 Marks and getting  bubbles
	in it.  And so on.

	One   particular   game-mechanics  effect   of  the     Law of
	Inconvenience  concerns crowds.   Germans  in  a  crowd (i.e.,
	pedestrians, other customers in  a store, and so forth) follow
	some  sort  of  macroscopic Brownian  motion   which makes  it
	impossible to move  efficiently  through the  group.   Walking
	down a street   is not a  trivial   task in Germany.  If   you
	actually do see an opening and go for it, you are either about
	to trip  over  somebody's dog  or   get hit by   a street-car.
	Germans  themselves  seem    largely immune  to   this effect,
	however.   I postulate  the  existence  of a  DEX  based Crowd
	Navigation  Skill  (useable  unskilled).  In fact,  a starting
	three adds  in this skill is probably   a  0-pt Adventure cost
	for native Germans.  I say  0-pt since obviously Ords have it,
	too.  The DN of moving though a crowd  should be a base of 12,
	with modifiers for number of people  with respect to the space
	involved (i.e., forty people standing for no reason outside of
	the one door by which  you may exit  your lecture is a  bigger
	penalty than only forty people on the whole street).  Negative
	success levels should  determine  consequences.   For example,
	riding  a  bike  along  a  street  near   a  crowd of   people
	disembarking from a   busy street-car: the   gm assigns  a  +5
	penalty  to the Crowd   Nav. DN, due to  the  number of people
	going  in completely  separate   directions  plus the  vehicle
	traffic on the street.   On a  minimal  failure, the rider  is
	forced to  stop and lose one  round of action.   On an average
	failure,  the   rider bumps  into   a streetsign,  doing minor
	damage.  On a good failure, the  rider misjudges the curb, the
	front of the bicycle goes out from  under him, and he skids on
	the sidewalk.    For   superior,  he collides   with   another
	bicyclist,  both falling   down  and  taking  damage.   On   a
	spectacular failure, he didn't  see the other streetcar coming
	from the opposite  direction, and the  last thing he remembers
	is  the annoying warning bell  before  he gets creamed.  It is
	important to note that the presence of other people is *not* a
	prerequisite for  a  Crowd Nav.  check (one  reason why  Crowd
	Nav. is DEX, and not PER, based).  See examples (2) and (4).

	EXAMPLES of the Law of  Inc.: 1) This  morning I needed to use
	Maple on  one of  the  computer-centre's machines.  The  Maple
	directory  had  mysteriously disappeared  off  of  the network
	disk.  2) I  just left to   get a cup of  coffee.   On the way
	there, I rode  my bike through a  perfectly empty part of  the
	campus.  Somebody stepped out  of nowhere and I almost  plowed
	into him---DN 12 Crowd Nav. Check.  3)  The coffee automat was
	out of order.  4)  Walking out of the  building onto  an empty
	sidewalk,  a bike  appeared out  of nowhere  and almost plowed
	into  me---DN 12 Crowd   Nav. Check.  5)   I  got back to  the
	computer centre and all of the terminals  were occupied.  Now,
	at this point, I succeeded  with a Stupid Action---``Of course
	walking  back and forth between  the  two terminal rooms isn't
	going to free up a  computer any faster, but  I'm gonna do  it
	anyway!''  Two minutes later,  there was a  machine available.
	6) Unfortunately,  the free machine was in  the PC room, where
	the machines inexplicably refuse to remap the backspace key to
	delete, and  where  the machines at  random  choose  to ignore
	certain typed capital letters . . .


	LAW OF EXCLUSION

	This is kind of a hard one to describe.  To simplify, ``If you
	aren't  already in a group,   you can't get  in.''   By way of
	example---as a  normal, starting first year university student
	in Germany, you are part of a ``group''  as it forms.  Come in
	later  (with, say, a bachelors  under your belt and a one-year
	scholarship) and you can't make those connections.

	There are  cases where  you cannot  avoid  becoming part  of a
	group, for example, moving onto a hall of a dormitory.  You're
	there and  the locals can't  do much to change  the fact.  The
	LoExclusion still   functions, though.  While in  an  American
	Dorm you would be slamming beer cans over your neighbor's head
	after  a 3am  session of  Hall Ball   the first  weekend after
	moving in, in Germany it'll be three weeks before conversation
	more detailed than ``Guten  Tag'' and ``Auf Wiedersehen'' take
	place in the common kitchen for the floor.

	One  of the     public signs of   the  Law   of  Exclusion  is
	Hoeflichkeit  (the German  word  for politeness).   You see, I
	have a  personal theory that  there are  two types of societal
	politeness.  The first you will find in Akasha, which think is
	good enough explanation.  The second  is a survival mechanism,
	a  trained response that takes the  place  of hitting somebody
	over the head  with an antelope femur.  You  see, in a country
	with  too many people  in  too little space (Germany's average
	population density  is ten times that of  America, but I think
	there are even more elbows per sidewalk  in German cities than
	that number alone would  suggest),   politeness is a  way   of
	paying attention to the proper  forms for interaction, and not
	to  the actual person.   Thus, the exclusion  ``group'' is the
	individual person for most public transactions, like shopping.
	Of  course, the larger groups are  the employee groups, and so
	forth.

	The Law of Exclusion also seems to  make it easier for Germans
	to identify foreigners and act in an appropriately patronising
	manner.  Of course, they  aren't being patronising on purpose;
	it just seems that way.   The most usual form  of this is that
	the  Germans will start  speaking to you   in English, even if
	they know less English than you know German.

	Language is affected   by the Law  of  Exclusion.  Non-Germans
	must  make  language checks  at  +2 to  the DN   to understand
	Germans (note the  many dialects also,  a shared function with
	the  Law of Inconvenience),  no  matter what language is being
	used for interaction (their accented  English can sometimes be
	more  confusing than   the  rapid-fire Bavarian they  normally
	use).  This  penalty does  *not*  apply to  exchanges  between
	non-Germans  in the German   cosm.  This  is  because the  two
	foreigners, though they  may be from different countries,  are
	still part of a non-German group.

	In fact, any interaction with a group  imposes a +2 penalty on
	a  non-member.  A  side effect  of  this  Law  is a  bonus for
	hierarchical  groups.     If  a  group    is  organised  in  a
	hierarchical, bureaucratic manner  around a specific goal (for
	example,     the    Deutsche Bundespost   is   a  bureaucratic
	organisation  organised around the   goal  of losing  people's
	mail),  members receive  a   +2 bonus for  actions which   are
	directly related  to that goal.  Not that,  as per the  Law of
	Inconvenience,  since most  managers  and supervisors are only
	*indirectly* related  to  the overall  goal,  they  don't  get
	bonuses.   Therefore,  usually the  person with  whom you must
	talk to straighten out a problem won't really be able to help.

	There are two  exceptions to the  Law of Exclusion.  The first
	is Sports.  It is easy to become part  of a Sport club (if the
	Law of  Inconvenience  doesn't prevent you  from registering).
	Such an  organisation   is, typically,  non-hierarchical,  and
	actually  encourages interaction   with new people.   The  Law
	still  poses  limitations, though.    There are only  specific
	times when one may join (start of  a semester for student type
	groups), and  it is almost impossible to  be in more  than one
	such group.  Reportedly some people  participate in two; there
	are myths about  people in three  such groups.  More than that
	is pure fairy tale . . .

	The second exception  is drinking.  First,  depending upon the
	situation, you  may become  part  of a  new group  of ``people
	drinking'' in a given  bar or pub.  More  importantly, though,
	drinking  negates  language  penalties  and can, indeed,  even
	provide bonuses.  The  value of the  number of drinks (a drink
	is alcohol  equal to one  beer, but in Germany  a  beer is 0.5
	litre  and 7--12% alcohol)  is subtracted from language DN, no
	matter who is talking  (German or non-German).  ote that  this
	does *not* negate  any penalties associated with being  drunk,
	which  may   *also* hinder  language  skills.   However,  as a
	general rule,  the +2 can be  gotten rid of  with a few drinks
	before  other ill effects  start setting in.  Someone with the
	Drinkin' skill could, conceivably, go from tourist-book German
	to Hegelian philosophy in a good night.



	LAW OF PARADOX

	This Law  applies mostly as  a limitation  to  the Tech axiom.
	While individual devices may exist up to  the full Tech axiom,
	no procedure may be, overall,   more efficent than it was   in
	1940 (that   would be about  Tech   21, right?).   The Law  of
	Inconvenience   is usually    very   good at   providing   the
	mechanisms.

	Some examples:

	1) Health insurance.  Most folks these days have an insurance
	card with a microchip containing their insurance information
	thereon.  However, all insurance payments for a three-month
	period must be made through the first doctor you visit in a
	quarter.  Thus, if you visit the dentist for your checkup, and
	then have to bring your kids to the doctor six times because
	they get chicken pox, payments for the doctor get paid to the
	dentist, and you the insured have to get it all straightened
	out.

	2)  Computers.    The  TU-Karlsruhe student  machine   has TeX
	loaded.  It  has  no student-available method for  previewing.
	Also, 3) while the machine is attached to a laser printer, the
	printer is hidden and the printouts are *hand* collated by the
	computer-centre staffers at   the  *most*  every   hour.  More
	likely you should expect to send the print command one day and
	pick up the output the following day.

	4) Banking.   They have ATMs.   The ATMs don't print receipts.
	You can  easily make direct  transfers to somebody else's bank
	account.  However, if you *don't* have an ATM card and you try
	to withdraw money from  a branch other than  the one where you
	opened your account,  they have to  call the  issuing bank for
	confirmation.  Don't ask  me what the  computers on the  desks
	are for . . .

	5) Bureaucracy.   The  residency  office  in Karlsruhe has   a
	computer.  The residency office  in  Kiel has files that  make
	the DMV  or  an Alexander's    department store look   modern.
	Therefore in moving from Kiel to Karlsruhe, the computers here
	weren't able to  access the old data.   Oh, and after I filled
	out the computer form for residency in Karlsruhe, and *before*
	the civil servant  typed anything into  the computer, he wrote
	all the necessary information out on a  sheet of paper.  While
	I  waited.  Then I looked over  the counter and saw that *all*
	of the workers had scads of little bittie notes covering their
	desks.  They also had computers.  Go figure.


NOTES
=====

That about  covers the  important  parts of the Germany  cosm.
One  thing does need  to be mentioned, though.  Doener Kebabs.
What the   hell, you  may ask,  is  a Doener?    Well, roughly
described it  is the Turkish equivalent of   a Gyro.  There is
much variation from place to place.  The one constant, though,
is existence.  There are   Doener  shops *everywhere*.   In  a
small city   like Karlsruhe, they   are  spaced roughly  every
400--500ft. along the  main pedestrian  zone.  What does  this
have  to do  with the reality?    I think the  Turkey cosm  is
planning on invading, and  that the deployed stelae are hidden
in Doener shops.  Just speculation, though . . .
