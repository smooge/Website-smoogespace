Remember that cosm idea I had? I said it was terrible, and now that I¹ve
done more work on it, I see my estimate was awfully conservative...

So, for alt.games.torg, which is so obviously under attack...

FLAMBERGE

MAG 9, SPI 6, TEC 23 (27), SOC 2.
A land of technical wonders and physical devastation. Indeed, the
atmosphere on the surface of this world has become noxious with pollution,
such that people would rather stay at home and insult each other over the
lobal computer network. Language is the most highly developed social
construct they have, and still they disagree how it should be used.

About that global network... residents of Tharkold and the Cyberpapacy who
have jacked into it describe it as a wasteland devoid of all but the most
basic ideas and useless chatter. They also say it¹s unreliable because
³sometimes the hardware just refuses to handshake.²

When spectacular technology is developed, most people simply use it
against each other because any sort of organized social activity aside
from small groups attacking other small groups is not supported by the
reality.

There is a Darkness Device in this cosm. Naturally, it didn¹t get along
with any other Darkness Devices, so it ended up here. Some people say it
looks like some sort of desktop computer and monitor, others say it looks
like a toilet laying on its back. Some people say it¹s both, and a handful
will actually admit that they¹ve seen it used both ways. The Darkness
Device¹s name is either Crapasciiklap or Pizwhynanmoan.

This cosm also has a High Lord, but he and his Darkness Device had a
falling out recently and aren¹t speaking to each other. Because the
Darkness Device responds to both names, there are some suggestions that it
is actually two Darkness Devices in one, and that the reason it¹s not out
sucking Possibility energy is that it¹s having a several millenium-long
argument with itself.

When the ³Darkness Device Pizwhynanmoan² was mentioned in earshot of the
Gaunt Man, he was reported to have ³shuddered and groaned for several
seconds, as if to forget some horror or banality too beyond the pale even
for him.² The shudder was described by an unnamed source in the Hellion
Court as ³John Houseman watching his first episode of Beavis and
Butthead.² (Reports that it is somehow connected to his True Death have
been greatly exaggerated, as three different Storm Knight teams would
attest if their skulls hadn¹t been made into this nifty set of drinking
vessels.)

Apeiros was scheduled to visit this cosm, but changed his plans at the
last moment when he saw how incredibly tacky its residents were.


World laws:

THE LAW OF ATHLETE'S MOUTH:
The cosm of Flamberge disdains any sort of friendly interaction. The
denizens usually spend all their time insulting each other, and this world
law is one of the reasons why.

All adds in all Charisma skills except Taunt cause a contradiction. Rolls
may be made using those skills, provided they are made not only Unskilled,
but as if Charisma were three points lower.

Storm knights spending extended periods of time in this cosm or any realms
under attack by this cosm must spend one Possibility every other month or
move a point from one of the nonallowed skills to either a scientific
skill or Taunt.

THE LAW OF BOASTFUL VAPORWARE:
This is the other reason citizens of Flamberge develop high levels of
Taunt. Normally, feats of technology above Tech Axion 23 are exponentially
difficult. However, the cosm can support Tech 27 items for a time,
provided that the person or group working on it can first Taunt three
times as many people as in their own group. If it¹s one person, he must
perform a Multi-Action on three people. A group of two people can succeed
if they can coordinate and succeed against six. And so on.

Aside from reading results against those people (which last a turn, so it
doesn¹t normally matter except in case of direct confrontation), the
result points are also read as a bonus to develop items up to Tech 27.

The result points are also used to figure the amount of time the device
will last. The world law cleans up after itself; such devices usually
break down because the members of a group can¹t agree upon a maintenance
schedule, how to use the thing, etc. It may also have something to do with
how long the taunt is remembered. The idea of maintenance taunting to
renew such a device has been suggested and ridiculed (guess where).

THE LAW OF TEAMWORK:
The Social axiom and world laws disallow large groups of people cold, but
it gives a sizeable advantage for small groups: If someone performs an
action that the others can coordinate with, other people helping can
contribute more than one point.

Each person in a group of three, eight, nine, or ten people can contribute
a second point to a coordinated effort if they get a Good or better result
on their coordination check.

Each person in a group of four, six, or seven people can contribute a
second point on a ??? or better Coordination check, and a third point on a
??? or better Coordination check.

Each person in a five person group can contribute a second point on a ???
Coordination check, a third point on a ??? or better Coordination check,
and a fourth point on a ??? or better Coordination check.

Groups of more than ten people can¹t coordinate tasks, which is why the
government of Flamberge couped itself to death a long time ago.

If this sounds like a great world law, keep in mind the difficulty people
will have forming an optimal group to utilize it. Some will decide the
group should be larger to accomodate more coordinators, some will decide
the group should be smaller and scare some of them off, etc. It all gets
very nasty.

It's okay, but does it have that Great Taste of Trout?
