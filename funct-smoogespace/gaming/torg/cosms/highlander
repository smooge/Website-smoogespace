Yup.

Here's a quick take on a higlander cosm:

Tech:   23 (27 for Highlander 2)
Magic:   6 (2 for Highlander 2)
Spirit: 12 (11 for Highlander 2)
Social: 21 (22 for Highlander 2)

Immortal powers come from the world laws, they are not spiritual or
magical in nature.

The Law of Immortality:

	There are some people born who are immortal.  An Immortal cannot die
unless his head is removed from his body.  TAn Immortal will fully heal
himsef within one day if they have suffered less than eight wounds and
his head is still attatched.  The less wounds suffered the sooner he
heals.  The Immortal will be in immense pain fromthe wounds and cannot
function to do anything more than simple actions if they have four to
five wounds.  Movement rate is reduced to 1/2 normal.  If they have six
or seven they can do no more than move at 1/4 normal rate.
	Immortals have their own society within society at large.  They form
friendships with mortals, many even marrying mortals.  When two
immortals meet they may form a friendship that can last centuries or
they may fight.  Many Immortals seek others out specificly to fill them
and take their Quickening (see below).  Immortals have a rule that they
will not fight on holy ground.  Unfortunately, no one remembers why this
is.  It is unkown if any Immortals who tried to do so would be punished
in some way or not.

The law of the Quickening:

	The Quickening is the magic that locks an Immortals age at either the
early twenties or the age at time of death.  This has lead to Immortals
that are only children.  They rarely live for long.  The Quickening also
allows Immortals to sense other Immortals and improve their melee
weapons skill.
	When one Immortal kills another the deceased's Quickening is released
and a portion of it can be absorbed by the victorious Immortal.	


The Quickening "skill":  Quickening is a Spirit based skill that can
never be higher than the reality skill.  Every Immortal begins with one
add in Quickening.  Every add in Quickening gives a +1 to Melee Weapons
(Sword).
	Quickening is used to detect other Immortals.  The more powerful the
Immortal the easier they are to detect.  Detection is automatic within
20m.
	Quickening is gathered from a dead Immortal by rolling a Quickening
total.  If the roll is sucessful one point of Quickening is gained.  In
addition one possibility is gained for every level of success.


That's all I have for now.
