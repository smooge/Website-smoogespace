Subject: [TORG:140] AD&D [Satire]

Picture the scene...
[A role-playing situation.]
'Hey, are you gonna play? I want to bring in Fred, my 21st Level 
thief-mage...'
'No, we're playing Torg.'
'Torg? Is that like AD&D?'
'No, it's nothing like AD&D. It's not even like the clones.'
'EErrgghh! Not AD&D!'

So, to pacify all those Paladin-playing, Mage-collecting, munchkin- 
rules-raping players [:) * lots] here is...

TORG AD&D!!

Not a AD&D-like setting, but that game itself...

Background: whatever AD&D side you want to play. Unfortunately, Torg 
doesn't have stuff like '17th Level Bard Instruments' or 'The Falcon 
Inn, Dravenport: The Cellar's Third Cupboard' type handbooks, or anything like that, so
you'll have to make do.
 
Axioms:
Magic 20
Wish parsers are available, but unreliable. Perhaps due to the Law of 
Min-Maxing, AD&D's highest axiom can be twisted to perform almost 
anything, irrespective of wht the axiom and limits of magic should 
allow.
Note that all spells are impressed, and tend to function more like 
technology than magic [see the Law Of Amerika below].

Social 13

Spiritual 19

Technological 14

World Laws:

The Law Of Min-Maxing
'Fred's such a a cool character! Look at these stats: Str 23, Con 
19, Dex 14, Cha 5, Int 3, Wis 2!!'

All AD&D characters suffer from 'rule-rape' and 'min-maxing': 
crunching those numbers to get the best deal possible, and/or a 
ludicrously unbalanced character.

Game effects include:

Out of a character's seven Attributes:

The best one gains +2 to the stat whilst under AD&D reality:
The 2 next best ones gain +1:
The next best one is unchanged:
The next 2 worst ones are at -1:
The worst attribute is at -2.
Player's choice if there is a tie in the stats. Skills are unaffected.

Example: Ravenhair the Mage-Bard Dark Half-Elf, Half Troll 'normally' 
has these stats:
DEX 8
STR 10
TOU 9
PER 6
MIN 9
CHA 11
SPI 6
Whilst under the effect of the LoM-M:
DEX 7
STR 11
TOU 10
PER 4
MIN 9 
CHA 13
SPI 5

In specific circumstances, modifiers & on-the-spot rules apply if the
player can come up with reasons why they should get a positive
modifier, etc., *but only* if it depends on a strict and anal-retentive
interpretation of the rules *or* bizarre leaps of logic in their 
applying:

'Fred falls 1600 metres and is as flat as a pancake'.
'NO HE ISN'T! Looking at the falling rules, I say that I can actively 
resist [I can actively dodge, so why not?]... spending possiblities and
cards, I have a toughness total of 34!'
'OK, so he's unharmed.'
'He springs up and gets an unarmed combat total of... 26, beating up 
the 13 guards that are down here!'

And so on.. 
 
Law Of Dungeoneering

'So, where's Fred now?'
'He's in the Grand Hall of the King of Kings [Cha 18, Int 17, Wis 19, 
Str 2, of course.] The walls are of ornate oak, and the curtains are 
of the finest silk... [etc.]'
Where are the doors? How big's the room?'
'The Grand Hall is 300 feet by 50 feet, exactly. Ten doors line each 
wall. The main door is made from solid silver.'
'What do the other doors look like?'
'Just doors.'

Yep, you guessed it. In Torg: AD&D,  all buildings, courts, market 
places, stalls, tables, trees, in fact virtually everything is a nice 
standard size: a multiple of 10 feet in any direction, and 
preferably the same length each way.
In addition, everything seems to be designed the same way, too: all 
doors look the same, apart from *really important* doors: which all 
look the same, too, as they all have important carvings, made out of 
precious stuff [which nobody ever robs]...
A side-effect of this Law is that sterotypes abound: for evry 
muscle-bound babarian 'from the Northern mountians', there's a 
haughty elf, or a grumpy dwarf, or a shining Knight with a horse 
called Swiftwind, or...

Again, you get the picture.

The Law Of Amerika [better name, anyone?]

'Fred's party is so kool! It's got Bob, a dwarf who came up with the 
idea of selling insurance and is now so rich he can afford to go 
adventuring, Xyycstrracil the Elven mage who's developed an 'Imitate 
Machine Gun' spell, and Klelven, a druid who's in tune with the 
Universe and totally at peace with reality: but likes to spend his 
time beating up on 0-level sword-fodder, 'cause he gets bored.'

This World Law is similar to that of the Star Trek 
reality [coming soon!]. Basically, it states that despite AD&D having 
axioms unlike Core Earth, despite having a different society and 
histroy to Core Earth, and despite being basically totally different 
to Core Earth, things nevertheless have a parallel to late 20th 
century America.
Perhaps as a reaction to the World Law, occasionally something 
totally bizarre will happen: everybody the players meet want to be 
adventurers, the lowly Orc that they fight just happens to own a +5 
sword, or people have totally unpronouncable names.

OK, so it's more a 'Bad Role-playing' cosm than an AD&D cosm...
