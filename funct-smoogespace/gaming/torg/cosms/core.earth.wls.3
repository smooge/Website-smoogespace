I have a problem with the CE Wl's from the DCWB.  Any world that has, as the
sole effect of one WL, the ability to add +2 to their storytelling rolls to
plant stories has a problem.

I thnk the rules poorly reflect the "feel" of Earth...the flexible, "we wipe
our buts with PE", able to adapt to anything feel of Earth.

Thus, my variant WL's for Earth:

World Laws of Earth:

Law of Possibilities: 
Earth is rich in Possibilities, earthers have an innate link to their reality
and can survive their reality's being invaded.  They also have great luck,
things seem to turn out for the best.  They are used to many viewpoints, and
can adapt easily to changing conditions.
Effects:
1. Possibility rated Earthers always have access to their world laws, even in
pure zones of other realities.
2. Whenever a possibility-rated person spends a Possibility on a roll, they
gain a +1 to their final total. Only counts for Possibilities spent from the
character's own store, not from eternity shards or cards.
3. Characters from Earth can seize initiative once per act.

Earth, through its vast store of PE, sends the characters a minute amount of
energy, enough to finesse the local reality.  Of, course, this makes them
contradictions and the characters must check to see if they disconnect
anytime they use their Earth Wl's.

Law of Prodigy:
Characters from Earth can be extremely skilled.  Can buy a prodigy package,
and once during their career, a character from Earth can learn 1 skill not
native to their cosm, buying it as if it were native (i.e. not doubling the
Possibility cost).

Law of Faith
In Earth's past, their have been dark times, but troubles pass, even the
darkest ones, and Earthers always seem to keep Hope alive.
1. Characters can convert to another faith skill with no loss in skill adds
(costs 1 poss or 1 month studying).
2. Earthers gain an additional Critical Moment per adventure.

There's a thought that fills your mind
A vision of a time
When knowledge was confined
And then we wonder how machines
Can steal each other's dreams
>From points that are unseen...it's real
