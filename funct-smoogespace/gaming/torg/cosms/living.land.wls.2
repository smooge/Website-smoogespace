This is actually me BP Chapman visiting relatives.
To celebrate the disappearance of the Living Land I thought I would
join the list of people who made a stab at coming up with World
Laws for the place.  
 
     I have some ideas but they are all that the beta-test stage
but I though I would throw them out to you to see what you think.
 
     My basic premise is to take what I know of the type of fiction
they are attempting to emulate and the type of world laws that were
being hinted at in the Sourcebook and try to turn them into
something specific.  
 
     Law Of The Lost:
          In the Living Land things get lost. Car keys, people,
rations, farms and cities. Part of the reason it is so hard to get
around in the Living Land is because of the Deep mist and the
compass curse but even with these thing travel through the living
land takes a lot longer than it should. The Law of the lost has
several effects. 
     First it if very easy to get lost. See the rules in the
Sourcebook. 
     Second, things taken into the living land tend to get lost. On
a setback the gm should try to separate the characters from some of
their belongings that are non-essential (gm's definition). This is
not an absolute requirement it is just suggested. This is also
mentioned in the book. 
     Third, Places get lost. As soon as a farm disappears into the
mist you never know if you will see it again. The resistance group
you found by the side of the road one time may not be there again
but it is hard to tell because you never are sure quit where you
are. 
     Fourth, Plot lines get lost. If you read the "Lost world"
books and you will find these books were written in a very choppy
fashion. So adventures in the Living Land should be written as if
each act were a small adventure into itself. A party might chase a
stolen eternity shard into the living land. Get there truck eaten.
Find a resistance community. Discover there community was about to
be attacked by spartans. Go to the spartan camp and defeat them.
Discover a clue as to the whereabouts of the shard. Venture forth.
Get caught by an Edeinos tribe. Go through ritual combat and
escape. Finally make it to New York and caught up with the thieves.
Basicly write the adventure like a serial.
     Also because thing get lost they also turn up at unlikely
spots. You be wandering around and suddenly discover an airport
with plains fuelled and ready to go or discover an old ally who
should be half way around the world, after all if all these people
and things are getting lost someone has to find them. To simulate
this I allow players to use connection cards to find things to help
them as well as people and if they do call on people I try to make
it someone they know even if that someone is supposed to be
somewhere else. "Well I just wandered out of town and couldn't find
my way back.
 
     The Law of Spiritual Power:
          These lost worlds are full of natives beating on drums
until the volcano erupts and Brarra Kaah called to Lanala and
brought down the Deep mist, and created that mystic flame thing in
north Canada. All this was by tapping into the basic spiritual
power of Lanala. I can see three ways to do this:
     The easy way. Say that this law allows direct invocations of
Lanala to be permanent if the invocation makes a specific success
level (I would say superior of spectacular)
 
     Less easy: Say that after a divine invocation the effect can
last for a time value equal to the number of point the invocation
was made by.
 
     The hard way: calculate the effect as if it were a spell and
use the base difficulty as the difficulty of the Focus roll that
has to be generated.
 
     I have not looked at how these would work they so I do not
know how hard or easy it would be to generate effects with one of
these methods

	Well what do you people think
BPC.
