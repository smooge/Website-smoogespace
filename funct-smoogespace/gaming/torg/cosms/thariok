This series is about a cosm I thought of and partially developed during the
Summer of 94.  I has a lot of time on my hands, and a empty Computer lab I could
spend hours in undisturbed.

When I created this cosm, I breifly thought about having it land, but then I
looked at the work I'ld have to do.  I dropped that idea right quick.  This is
the first of four parts.  Enjoy & netpick.

Welcome to the realm of the Prime Spirit, Ok.  Thariok is the cosm where
technology and the divine meet.  Everything has an essence that makes it what it
is.  By pouring spiritual power into a technological shell, wondrous and
terrifying things can brought forth.

---Axioms and World Laws---

AXIOMS
Spirit 26 - The current world view is based on Animisim, that everything has a
spirit.  The spirits, collectivelly known as Harumoks, inhabit and define
everything, including poeple and machines.  The strength of the spirits is such
that they can act on their own without conduits for divine power.  The axiom was
at 9 at the begining of the Age of Spirits, but it has risen astronomically in
the past 700 years (since 12195 AR). 

Social 23 - An interplanetary culture where planets are divided into Districts
of roughly equal population and are governered fairly efficently by a inter-
planetary consortium of technocrats known as The Consortium.  Low population
density and the Law of Interconnection has resulted in dissention and conflict
between Districts being rare, but not unknown.  Core Earth-style, nuclear
families are almost totally dissolved in favor of community-wide support /
education / rearing, but familial ties are still honored.  Standardization is
the rule, not the exception.

Tech 28 - Before The Awakening, Thariok achieved a Tech of 24.  With the boost
from SpiriTech, the world has advanced and is now a fully mature nanotech
society.  Cities are active on the second, forth, sixth, and eighth planets as
well as on the moon around the seventh planet.  Personal communication is
availible at a thought, and interplanetary communication is not limited by the
speed of light.  Information/pattern production is the basic stardard for
currency / credit / trade.  Due to the Law of Patience, travel technology has
not advanced much beyond fast interplanetary travel and slow interstellar travel
(e.g. no teleportation). 

Magic 1 - Never much of a force, it was never developed by the Tharians.  It has
been repressed / supplanted by faith and technology.  It is on the verge of
dropping to 0.

WORLD LAWS
Law of Patience - "Good things come to those who wait" is more than a cliche in
Tharian culture, it is a tenant of their religion and a core part of their
culture.  There are three passive game effects of this law.
    The first being an increase in life span to allow those 'good things' that
are promised, time to happen.  Every native or transformed being can expect the
lifespan to double once past a normal-length childhood (~16 years).  Tharians
can expect to live for ~200 years, with advanced medicine and SpiriTech, old age
is considered at ~190 years.
    Second effect is that if a Tharian is affected by a Flurry or plays a Haste
card, he may elect to have only one action, but he 'saves' his energies.  This
is represented by a +3 bonus to the total of a connected action attempted in the
next round.  Only one +3 Patience' bonus can be awarded for a round to the
Tharian.
    The third effect affects all those operating under this Law.  Characters (PC
& NPC) have a patience 'buffer'.  Whenever a Conflict line event can effect
them, they can choose to move the event to their buffer and 'save' it - to
cancel or enhance a later event, or when needed.  A favorable effect can cancel
out an unfavorable event even if they are not equivilent in 'power' i.e. a
Flurry can cancel a Setback.  Note that a character can have *two* effects
active at the same time. i.e. a saved Up with a called for Up allows for two
roll-agains, should the buffer be emptied.  Should an character exit a scene
with a buffered effect, the effect is immediate, for better or worse.

For example, a Consortium Agent had chosen to 'save' a Setback he got early in a
battle with the Storm Knights.  Now a Flurry shows as his action line, he has
the choice of getting rid of his bad result (emptying his buffer), or keeping
his buffer full and accepting the result.  He decides to spend his Setback on
the Flurry and they cancel' out.
 
    As for non-rule effects, the people and events tend to be quieter and less
hectic than standard Core Earth.  Tharians may be considered Aka-aligned.  Just
imagine what a Nile Hero (Law of Action) would feel like being in the Tharian
reality (Law of Patience).

Law of Interconnection - In line with the belief that every thing is a part of
Ok, Tharians see everything as connected somehow.  Surprisingly, this has had
little effect in raising the Social Axiom beyond 23, where standard rights of
groups and individuals are accepted as the norm.  It has allowed for the rapid
rise in the Axiom up to this point though, having been 22 since the Age of
Reason.  There are three game effects of this, two passive and one active.
     One passive effect is that any sublot cards played by a character operating
under this law must relate to any other subplot cards played.  If this condition
cannot be met, the card must be "cashed in".
     The other passive effect results in a +1 to the total of any skill that is
used to find connections between things while under this reality.  Evidence
Analysis is an obvious choice, but the GM may assign the bonus for appropriate
uses of other skills such as Science or Scholar.  The GM rules on what is
appropriate.
     The active effect is the connection between the divine and the
techological.  This connection has been in place since the Awakening, and along
with the increase of the Spirit Axiom it has created a new skill, SpiriTech. 
SpiriTech allows for spirits to be wed to technology, and lets technology act as
a conduit for the spirits.  See Equipment and Skills for more details on the
skill.
     Non-game effects are hard to seperate from the culture.  Tharians as a
rule, love puzzles and riddles.  Those that are well designed or intricately
composed are considered 'high' art.  They are also curious as a race, always
trying to find the connections that must be there.

     This is sometimes contradictory to the LoPatience.  Tharians are curious,
but they recognize that they may have to wait to satiate the need to know.  The
combination of the two Laws has neither boosted nor hindered axiom advances. 
The natural curiosity that would push axioms up has countered the slowing effect
of patience.

---Darkness Device and The High Lord----

DARKNESS DEVICE
     This is the last device sent through the Infiniverse.  Being last, it has
had to make do with very few possibilities.  Thariok has a realitively small
(~750 million) population, allowing the darkness device to remain 'undiscovered'
since the begining of the Age of Man.  Quirquoktix also has a preference for
both technology and spiritual power.  These three factors have led it to remain
relatively dormant until lately.  The only action it has taken prior to it's
unearthing is to provide the second 'Spark' metioned in the Book of Begining.

DEX - 0
STR - 0
TOU - 200
PER - ~~
MIN - ~~
CHA - ~~
SPI - ~~

Posibilities:  very few hundred

    Quirquoktix (kweer-Kwawk-tiks) is a perfectly rectangular (down to the atom)
solid mesuring 1m x 4m x 9m.  Should anyone actually touch the surface, they
would find it to be nearly frictionless.  Only by the lack of background can it
be visually located, it doesn't reflect more than 1% of any EM energy, including
light.
    Quirquoktix is a subtle, surprisingly patient device that has allowed itself
to be discovered.  The infiniverse-wide change in possibility energy due to the
War may have prodded it into action.
    It was recently found on Larok, the moon of Thariok.  Quirquoktix called out
its name, in true Harumok fashion, after it was fully unearthed by auto-diggers
and the first rays of the sun hit the device since the Age of Man.  On every
availible carrier wave, it broadcast "Quirquoktix".  The scientists overseeing
the 'diggers at the Larok base were killed when their NanoComm recievers
exploded from the overload.  This has many SpiriTechnictions puzzled as to what
is going on.  The lack of the -ok suffix, the raw power this new spirit has
demostrated, and its sudden disappearance have generated a quiet contriversy. 
Only one man can answer these concerns.
    Purthan Roff is that man.  Quirquoktix has chosen Purthan to be its High
Lord.  Purthan is an ambitious, surprisingly ruthless technocrat who is now
heads the Consortium, thanks to Quirquoktix.  Purthan not an example of the
normally patient, relaxed Tharians.
    Quirquoktix has Purthan believing himself to be the sole Tharian to hear the
spirit voice of 'The machine [-tix] not from Ok [-quok-] but from Beyond [Quir-
].'  It realizes that Purthan still has his race's best interests at heart, but
is slowly manipulating Purthan to point out 'conspiricies' and 'traitors' to the
peace and prosperity of the Tharians.  These consipiricies are constructed to
make traitors out of those who will try to block Purthan.  The accusations also
serve to alienate Purthan from his people, trying to work against the Law of
Interconnection.  Slow, small steps are less likely to be noticed than a large
leap.
    The device has plans for Purthan to lead an 'exploratory force' to other
cosms to 'Awaken' the spirits that are there.  To this end, it has dropped a
dimthread into a lightly populated area in China, where spirit worship is
already entrenched.  It plans to have Purthan send special Consortium agents
there to plant 'homing beacons', allowing it to make a permenent connection.

    "In the begining there was Nothing.
     Nothing waited.
     And Nothing waited.
     Then from Beyond, the Spark came and Ok was.
     Ok was all that was.  This was the first age, the Age of One.
     Ok wanted to be more, so Ok became Aok, Harok, Parthok and Thariok.
     But each was less than the whole Ok, so each was limited.
     Together, They made the universe.  And being limited, They tired.
     They slept the Sleep.
     So in their Sleep, did the second Age pass and the third come to be.  The
Age of Creation gave way to the Age of Being, as it does in all things.
     Our world was made, and we did come to pass by a second Spark.
     And with our comming, the forth Age dawned, the Age of Man.
     When Man first recorded his ideas, a fifth Age came upon the waiting
universe.
     It swept all before into history, for it was the Age of Reason.  
     So begins this book."
          - Book of Begining; Chapter 1 (From Nothing) [abridged]


    "But some said the Sleep was not for eternity.  
     They said to have patience, for as Creation took time, so shall Their
recovery.
     And in waiting We grew strong.  We were repaid a hundred, nay a thousand,
fold for our time.
     In the year of Man 96838 [12195 AR], They awoke.
     As Sleep crept away, They found the world that They had made had changed.
     As They awoke, so too did the spirit of the things that were made from
Them.  And those that were made from those that were made from Them.
     Thus all things awoke and so began the Awakening, heralding the sixth Age
of the universe, the Age of Spirits.
     So begins this book."
         - Book of Now; Chapter 1 (The Awakening) [abridged]

    "So when the Sleep left Them, They Awoke.
     When They awoke, so did all the parts of Ok.
     But just the parts, for the parts are less than the whole.
     Should Ok be called to fully awake, what Is will be no more.
     For as Ok is everything, everything is Ok.
     Wakened, Ok will reform from all,
     Including you, Seeker, reader of this passage.
     Aok, Thariok, Parthok and Harok will join, bringing all their now un-
sleeping spawn.
          - Book of Endings; Chapter 1 (Ok Awakening) [abridged]
     
     So move through the shell that binds you, when your time is due.
     Through and onward, to be your spawn and your birthers.
     Seeing what you have Seen,
     Knowing what you have Learned,
     Finding what you have Sought,
     These will bring you closer to the Four that birthed you in the Second Age,
yet let you lie Sleeping 'til the Sixth.
     As you waited patiently for life,
     As you waited patiently for death,
     May you wait patiently in death for Ok
          - Book of Endings; Chapter 7 (Prayers for the Dead) [abridged]
     

    The Harumok are derived from Ok, 'One/Prime', through a long chain.  It
starts with Ok, then to the elemental spirits of earth, heat, water, and air to
begin with, and then on down the derivation line.  People have also 'created'
spirits because emotions are real.  The emotions are derived from people who can
trace their lineage back to Ok, and by possessing some of the spirit of Ok the
emotions also Awoke.
    As everything is connected to Ok and by the influence of the
LoInterconnetion, there are no enemies of the mythos, thus no Ward Enemy
miracle.
    There is no single spirit (excluding Ok) for one 'type'.  There are many
heat spirits, and many fury spirits, etc.  But spirits of a type are connected,
and what one knows, all of that type know.
    The magnitude of an object determines how many spirits are present. 
According to Tharian beliefs, the only difference between a small lava vent and
something like Krakatoa is the number of earth, heat, lava, smoke, and fury
spirits.  Of course plate tectonics and chaos theory have something to do with
it, but the Harumok have a role to play as well.
    As noted above, more than one spirit type may inhabit a conceptual object. 
New objects usually have many spirits mixing in them.  But in the mix, the
LoInterconnection may connect the spirits in gestaltic ways, and a new spirit 
can be created.  At the time of creation, the spirit calls out its name to be
know as.  All the Harumok add the -ok suffix to honor Ok, literally adding "of
Ok" to their name.
    During the Awakening and the years immediately after, Thariok was virtually
screaming with names of the Harumok awakening.  With the low Spirit Axiom, the
people who heard were generally considered playing without a full deck.  As the
years went by and the Spiritual axiom rose, the Harumok was finally accepted,
cataloged, and classified.  This was to be expected from a cosm with a fairly
high Tech and Social axiom.  Within the past 300 years few spirits have be
spawned, and now hearing one calling bestows great prestige.

     There are *many* spirits, but here is a quick primer on the most known
spirits:

     Ok : Prime/One spirit.  The 'parent' of all that is, the most revered of
the Harumok.  Also the name of the sun in the Tharian system.  Although revered,
he is *never* invoked.  That would be bad.  Read the Book of Ending, at the
begining of this file.
     Garrok : The spirit of kinetics. 
     Antiok : The spirit of light.  During the optical computer age (~ Tech 25)
it was frequently called on, but has declined with the advent of nanotech
computers.
     Thariok : Spirit of earth.  The second most revered of the Harumok, as it
is the homeworld's name and the 'parent' to Dok.
     Dok : Spirit of patience.  When frustrated or about to lose their cool,
many Tharians mutter a small prayer to it.  Merely saying its name provides most
Tharians with the patience they need.
     Porthok : Water spirit.
     Harok : The spirit of air (gases).
     Juum'pok : The spirit of cold.  Often appealed to to go away, epecially
during space travel.
     Aok : Spirit of heat.  Also used in space travel and power generation
plants.
     Vr'rok : Ths spirit of Reproduction.  Called on for use by SpiriTechs for
incubators and copiers. 
     Vitok : Victory spirit.  Frequently called on to help in conflicts.
     Jok : The spirit of fury.  Rarely called on, but can be devastating if
invoked.
     Quiok : Not a spirit as such, as it has no lineage to Ok.  It literally
means 'having no Ok', and is used in describing vacuums and can be an insult. 
It is usually called on to stop something.
     Tixok : The sprit of nanomachines called constructors.  Always called on to
build structures and to ensure a working society.  Currently, the most invoked
spirit.

Nanotech suppliments

Modular 'building blocks':
    CommBlocks - 1-2 millimeter blocks that can send or recieve data.
    SensoBlocks - 1-2 millimeter blocks that can detect various forms of 
energy.
    LogiBlocks - 1-2 micron blocks of logic circuts.
    StoreBlocks - 1-2 micron blocks for storing data.

Nanomachines:
    Grippers - for grasping matter on a nanotech scale
    Constructors - for building structures out of nanomachines
    Bio-structors - for building quasi-living/bio-compatable constructs out of
nanomachines
    Bio-semblers - for building living biomass from base ingredients
    Pizo-semblers - for building crystals from base ingredients
    Carbo-semblers - for building organic compounds (not living stuff) from base
ingredients

NanoStore - libraries/ per boost, adds 
NanoLimbs - provides mutable limbs

NanoComm - This is a standard enhancement.  It is so standard, it is considered
odd if a person doesn't have it.  This body-wide network of SensoBlocks,
LogiBlocks and CommBlocks (2/1/7 respective ratios) gathers data on the host,
his enviroment, and any communication channel that is active.  This information
can be accessed by the host or anyone else the host allows communication with. 
This allows non-boosted signals to resemble telepathy within a 1 km range. 
Telepathic-like communication is possible outside this range, but only in the
presence (1 km) of a booster network.  The booster network in the Thariok cosm
covers every square kilometer of any inhabited world, limiting real-time
telepathic communication to the surface and near-orbits of any one planet. 
Inter-planetary FTL communication cannot support the data transfer rate
neccessary of telepathic comunication, though it is currently one of the most
intensely researched areas of Tharian SpiriTech.

NanoStrength - adds to STR
NanoFlexes - boosts signals and axion response times / DEX boost
NanoComp - internalized computer / MIN boost
*NanoHero - spirit boost

NanoDoc - Carbo-semblers, bio-semblers and bio-constructors combine to react to
damage to the owner.  This enhancement will make a First Aid roll automatically
when the owner reaches Heavy or Mortal Wound, or goes unconcious.  The owner can
also activte/deactivate it by mental command.  While deactivated, it will
automatically apply First Aid only when the owner reaches Mortal Wound.  It has
a First Aid skill of the owner's TOU+3, or 15, which ever is more.  It will
continue to attempt First Aid until the owner is dead (4 wounds), is successful,
or it is mentally deactivated.  Each First Aid attempt takes 3 rounds
     In addition, the owner can benefit from First Aid twice in a 24-hour
period.  The enhancement is the only way to recieve the second benefit.

NanoSpikes - By programming bio-structors, retractable claws/fangs/spikes in
various adds can be had.  Adds range from +1, for small raised bumps on the
knuckles, to +8, for wicked blades whose edges are just fifty angstroms wide. 
One 'unit' in needed for each 'area', one per hand/foot (+6 max), finger/toe (+4
max), elbow/forearm (+8 max), teeth (+3 max), tongue (+3 max) or knee (+8 max).

NanoWings -  By adding reserves of bio-structors, wings can be formed for
gliding.  The glide ratio is about 6 to 1.  The wings will automatically deploy 
to reduce impact speed to value 2.  This requires that a portion of skin be left
bare under the arms or across the shoulders.  If covered, the growing of the
wings will inflict a base 15 damage against any restrictive coverings.  If the
wings do not score a KO, a wound, or exceed the covering's TOU in shock they
will not deploy.

NanoSkin - By precise control of bio-structors, armour adds up to +4 are
availible.  By using Sensoblocks, the Logiblocks can control the bio-structors
to form quasi-crystal forms around cells of the skin, muscle and bone around the
predicted impact sight.  Immediately afterwards, they dissasemble the forms,
softening the flesh.  The result is that flesh feels and looks identical to non-
treated flesh, but feels like hard plastic under impact.  This is an automatic
reaction, the owner is not required to be awake.

NanoSkel - Skeletal enhacement/tou boost
NanoEye - eye mods
NanoEar - Ear mods
NanoShnoze - nose/taste mods
*NanoCharm - charm boost

NanoTox - Carbo-semblers are located in the liver, mouth, heart, pia matter and
lymph nodes in the owners body.  Under control, the nanomachines produce anti-
toxins to any substance that enters the body and does direct harm to the owner. 
This is provides a +10 to base TOU when resisting toxins.  This does not include
biological agents, viruses, or totally unknown toxins.  When an unkown toxin is
encountered, the owner gets no bonus, but for every hour after the first
introduction, the system 'learns' about the toxin and will add a cumulative +1
per hour to any TOU totals to resist it.  This continues until the +10 add is
reached, it is then considered a known toxin.  The list of toxins can be updated
from a specialized medical programmer by just pressing the programmer up against
the skin.

NanoRepair - Specialized bio-semblers are placed in every cell of the owner. 
These machines read the DNA code once and then actively repair it when a mistake
is made during transcription or duplication.  It also checks the RNA of the host
for forgein strands.  This allows the owner to resist all forms of viral
infection or any sort of DNA alteration with the owners base TOU +15, even after
death.
     A specialized form of this enhancement can be programmed by a medical
programmer to cure DNA alteration based problems and then deativate itself to be
excreted normally.  It 'cures' with a Medicine skill of 25.

NanoHair - The owners hair has lines of constructors along each hair.  The
constructors can extend or retract their connections on command from a small
group of Logiblocks.  By doing so, the hair has the ability to move.  Without a
NanoComm and NanoComp, the hair has +0 adds, and can only act under preprogramed
reactions to the owner.  With the NanoComm and NanoComp, hair can have adds up
to +4 and is under mental control.
     At +0 adds, the hair can only form weak structures like curls, waves, buns,
etc.  Hair with greater adds have the following stats:

     DEX (owner's PER -2)
     STR (5 + adds)
     TOU 8
     PER/MIN/CHA/SPI 0


NanoBlock - prevents nano-machines from working
NanoDampers - energy feild damping
NanoTouch - touch boost
NanoOrgans - tou boost/drugs
ScaleSkin - larger armour adds to +9 w/o penalties

Non nanotech stuff

Deconstructor - allows for remote disassembly of any constructors
*Scrambler - alters nanotech in body
*SpiriStore - storage of miracles under Axiom ##.
*SoulScan - spirit detector
*SpiriVat - all purpose medical Vat/spirit healer/nano installer
Gooper - restraining device
Resistor - motion stopper
*AuraScanner - dectects and idetify someone by their spiritual contents
*Spirit Armour - allows for the spirits of the owner's predecessors to inhabit
and protect the wearer.  Req. SpiriTech
*Killer - automatically causes nano-tech to revert to inert matter

NEW SKILLS

SpiriTech is a method and belief that allow for machines to house divine spirits
and for the spirits to activate machines.

LoInterconnection (as well as common sense) forces the realization that the 
welfare of the child is connected to the community as the community's welfare 
is connected to the child.  It is in the best interest of all concerned 
parties that all the children get a certain level of education, medical care 
and socialization with its peers.
     The parents can check on their child with just a thought, and if anything
does happen to the child, the child would certainly try to contact the parents/
monitor.  With that level of communication, I think a parent (under the
LoInteraction) could leave child-rearing to the community.  Once the child can
leave the mother (~2 yrs, I guess) it is placed in the community's care, the
Brood.  Remember that both the rights of the community and the parents are held
in equal regard at Social 23 (and the parent is also a member of the community).
     With that said, back to the questions at hand.
     Parents and children can see and interact with each other as they desire 
-barring teaching sessions or medical reasons.
     There is a great deal of importance to a name, the full name  is actually
four names. the first is the birth name - given by the parents, the second is
the Brood name, the third is the community's name.  The fourth is chosen by the
spawn when it moves from the Brood house to it's own dwelling - this is the
'common' name people use.  An 'official' name for a legal document not only 
includes the individual's full name, but the names of the parents and the last 
ten Brood names for the community, as well as the community's name.
     I always pictured Tharians as pretty normal human beings - I have to say 
that the love between parent and child is still stronger that the ties to the 
community, although not by much.  Sibling ties are just as strong as the 
community ties and frequently all the members of a community's Brood consider 
themselves brother and sisters.

 *> Tech 28 - Before The Awakening, Thariok achieved a Tech of 24.  With the

 *> nanotech society.  Cities are active on the second, forth, sixth, and 
#*> eighth planets as well as on the moon around the seventh planet.  Personal 
#*> communication is available at a thought, and interplanetary communication 
#*> is not limited by the speed of light.  Information/pattern production is 
 *> the basic standard for currency / credit / trade.  Due to the Law of 
 *> Patience, travel technology has not advanced much beyond fast interplanetary 
 *> travel and slow interstellar travel (e.g. no teleportation).

 *they'd find it a bizarre concept: if everything is alive because it

      I wrote this before I got the SG SB.  But now that I'm thinking 
about it, I think it would be nothing more that a curiosity - "Yes, our machines
are already alive.  Alive with the Harumok.  As are yours.  Yours are just a bit
'squishier' though."
  
#Is this due to spiritech or an extrapolation of the straight Tech axiom?

      Extrapolation mostly - SpiriTech boosted what they could do after the
Awakening, but they have since raised the Tech axiom to support the non-
SpiriTech devices that could emulate the SpiriTech Devices.  Currently,
SpiriTech is used the most frequently, but as spirits can sometimes be 
fickle - there are pure Tech back-ups for everything.

 *Is it particularly foggy? :-)

#Are there any unusual (ie, different from what we're used to) effects
#due to the low axiom?  Nippon Tech has a couple at Magic 2.

     I always thought that the NT 'fogginess' was from both the Spirit _and_ the
Magic Axioms being so low.   The LL has Magic 0, but it is said that Kaah
summoned the Deep Mist after landing, so it doesn't look like the 
'fogginess' is the result of low Magic Axioms in-and-of themselves.
     With the Spirit Axiom being 26 I didn't envision any ambient fog due 
to low Magic.  Aside from losing the deja vu 'feeling'  I can't think of 
anything else of note.

#old age rather than just "past their prime"?
#
#Has the lifespan always been about 200 with medicine and spiritech
#only pushing back the definition of old age?

      Originally I saw the lifespan was about ~100 yrs, with both medicine and
SpiriTech pushing back both the definition of 'old age'.  I always considered
'old age' to start when assistance is needed for some basic tasks, like
breathing or eating.  Up to that point, in Thariok at lest, being in your prime
lasts until 'old age'.  LoPatience extends the life cycle after the activity of
childhood.
      Overall, each Tharian can expect an active adult life for ~170 years.

     The people are quieter and less hectic for both reasons - the way 
they were raised, and the WL (which also affected the way they were 
raised).  I never saw it as an either-or proposition.  And yes, the 
rocket ranger Major Damage could disconnect, should he try to pursue 
the nefarious Doctor Dictionary with his Grammatical Gamma Ray(tm) 
through a Thariok zone.

 *> DARKNESS DEVICE
 *>      This is the last device sent through the Infiniverse.  Being last, 
 *> it has had to make do with very few possibilities.  Thariok has a 
 *
 *  An interesting twist.

     Hey!  When dealing out anything, someone _always_ gets the spit end of the

 *> relatively small (~750 million) population, allowing the darkness device 
 *> to remain 'undiscovered' since the beginning of the Age of Man.  
 *> Quirquoktix also has a preference for both technology and spiritual power.
 *
 *  Is it co-incidence that it's residing in a cosm that has an emphasis on 
 *both? There hasn't been any definite description of this from the 
 *cannon material that I know of, so house rules have tended to run the 
 *gamut of DDs being dispatched to particular cosms deliberately (which 
 *can be thought to include the assertion that _each_ and _every_ cosm 
 *has its own DD), through to the DDs being sent out at random (possibly 
 *including the idea that with a bit of preparation a DD can actually mold
 *a cosm to its tastes).
 
     My view:
          DD's are a piece of TNO - he couldn't actually 'create' them.
          TNO vested the DD's with all his creative energy - read Possibilities.
          TNO sent them at random through the one cosmiverse.
          The DD 'sowed' the 'seeds' for this cosm - the second Spark
     Now, back to the questions.  No, it is not coincidence.  Yes, this DD set
the 'mold' the cosm when it arrived and gave the second Spark (Book of
Beginnings, CH 1:LN 11).  It let the sentients develop the cosm - little did
they realize that they were developing the cosm for the DD.
     Which brings me to another point, that the inhabitants are all tainted 
by the second Spark.  They owe the DD for the Spark, and owing a DD is
_always_ a bad thing.  I'm not saying that this cosm is doomed, but the fight 
to keep from becoming the servants of the DD is going to be a never-ending 
battle for Tharians. 
          
#> Possibilities:  very few hundred
#
#Actually we don't know how many P-Points a 'virgin' Darkness Device is
#going to have, we've only seen writeups on active DDs and one that got
#its butt kicked in a fight with another DD.  A few hundred may be the
#normal starting amount and then the DD's build up into the thousands
#by conquering other realities.

     (see above)  For some mysterious reason I imagined that the DD each had a
beginning store of ~500 Possibilities - adding more for each cosm conquered.  If
you wanted a number for starting possibilities for Quirquoktix - 200 tops.

*>    Quirquoktix (kweer-Kwawk-tiks) is a perfectly rectangular (down to the

along with some other stuff.  Its all Ted Tuners fault, blame him! :)

#*Part 3
#*
#>      For as Ok is everything, everything is Ok.
#
#"Everything is ok", boo hiss!  

    I must have read that passage a hundred times and I never saw that.  Just
in case anyone is wondering, Ok is pronounced with a short 'o' and a hard 'k'
much like the 'ock' in 'mock'.  No matter what KS Jim says. :)

 *>     There are *many* spirits, but here is a quick primer on the most known
 *> spirits:
 *
 *  Are there spirits for abstract concepts as well as material objects and 
 * emotional states?

     I thought about opening that can of worms, but the top of the can was
above 45,000 ft and I didn't have a oxygen mask at the time, so I simply
ignored that ^little^ question.
     Now I would say that there may be a few, but most abstract concepts are
difficult to hold & comprehend for a long time (Unlike concrete and conceptual
objects).
     <handwaving>It far too short a time for the LoInterconnection to gestalt
spirits to form abstract spirits. </handwaving>
     Besides, as soon as that happens it becomes concrete and then the death
spirit is roaming the land.  Not good
 
 *> Juum'pok : The spirit of cold.  Often appealed to go away, especially
 *> during space travel.
 *
 *  I'm not too good at physics, but it seems to me that it might be 
 *possible to use both the spirit of heat and cold in energy generation 
 *for a more efficient form of heat pump than mere thermodynamic law 
 *would allow. This would be desirable since it would keep a powerful 
 *spirit from getting angry because it feels unappreciated (or is that 

     You're a SpiriTechnician already!  I never though of the spirits as having
the trait of resentment, though.  I thought of them more like animals, minimally
intelligent and just existing as the pure form of their embodiment.

 *> Quiok : Not a spirit as such, as it has no lineage to Ok.  It literally
 *> means 'having no Ok', and is used in describing vacuums and can be 
 *> an insult. It is usually called on to stop something.
 *
 *  Is it the spirit of vacuums per se though? This relates back to my 
 *question on spirits of abstracts; if it is a spirit of an idea that 
 *relates to the metaphysical framework of how spirits exist within 
 *Thariok, then even if it is the spirit of nothingness, then it still 
 *derives a lineage from Ok. Unless of course, 'having no Ok' means that 
 *it is the spirit of things which do not relate to the framework of 
 *spirits within Thariok (ie, is something 'other than Ok')

     Ow, my head hurts.  If I have successfully comprehended your question, I'd
have to go with second option.  I'll take some aspirin now.

#*Part 4
#*
 *  Nano stuff. Overall pretty good. The only thing that struck me was 
 *the presence of things like NanoSpikes. Now, obviously something that 
 *allows offensive weapons to be grown is going to be handy for PC SKs 
 *fighting in the P-Wars. However, is the presence of the likes of 
 *NanoSpikes any indication on the nature of Thariok society? Do many 
 *people actually need them? And what percentage that have them actually 
 *use them? Are the machinations of the DD upon Purthan causing changes 
 *in Thariok society that are making NanoSpikes more popular?

     I wrote this over the course a two months, working on one bit at a time. 
This section started out as a list of "What would be cool stuff for a
sufficiently-advanced nanotech-using SK?"  This spiritual/social aspect of the
Cosm evolved much later and I never really went back to re-edit the nanotech
list.  On to the questions.
     No, but it is the natural extension of the ability to reform body
structures to make useful tools, like tweezers, socket wrenches, hole punches,
screwdrivers, etc.  Few people ever get the 'combat versions', although about 1/
4
have the 'tool' versions.  Even fewer use them in combat situations.
     Although I would expect to see a rise in both categories as the DD moves
Purthan into conflict with the DIstricts.  And with the waking of the DD, the
taint on the ancestors of the Tharians may also increase these numbers. 

 *>NEW SKILLS
 *> 
 *> SpiriTech is a method and belief that allow for machines to house divine 
 *> spirits and for the spirits to activate machines.

 *  The SpiriTech stuff seems good, but I wonder how much further it could 
 *'in theory' be taken. In Thariok society the animistic slant of their 
 *religion means that spirits can inhabit machines and in turn activate 
 *them, and I presume that's as far as they have taken things for cultural 
 *reasons. But, using OccultTech as a model, the idea of spirit/machine 
 *interface could be taken further so that, for example, machines could 
 *be used to produce miracles with minimal intervention from spirits/
 *deities/whatever, rather than the SpiriStore method of just holding a 
 *miracle on tap. Machines could even be used to substitute for spirits.

     Then at that point in development, the metal, electricity, and other
machine spirits would gestalt into the new mega-machine spirit.  It would be the
spirit that provides the miracles (in the shell of the mega-machine), so no
axiomatic violations would occur, and no substitution could be made.
     Is that a piece of handwaving work or what.

 *  Of course, except under specialised circumstances SpiriTech of this 
 *type would not be able to be developed. I would presume that such 
 *tricks would need to be supported by a world law of some type (like the 
 *LoInterconnection :-). Normally high Spirit and Tech would only be 
 *able to _complement_ each other, not actually _substitute_. But if 
 *Tharians are going to be running around on CE, then sooner or later 
 *the idea is bound to occur to some of the more unscrupulous of them...

     True, but the LoInterconnection is not quite the LoDomination. "Let's work
together" as opposed to "You will work for me".  So making a machine to
substitute for the spirits wouldn't work anyway.

#Do you have any actual
#ideas on how spiritech works?  It's not like Tharkold's technomagic
#is very helpful in showing how you can actually combine technology
#with something else.

     I'm not sure, but I figure it's a ritual performed with science (the
SpiriTech skill) that allows the spirits to assist mechanical devices (without
specific miracles) and for mechanical devices to help express the spirit's
embodiment.  (See above, heat engine example)
     A SpiriTech railgun would have a trigger to summon many garroks into the
slug and having the barrel act as a guide for direction.  The garroks get to
express their embodiment (motion) and the slug gets velocity from the garroks. 
I guess the SpiriTech part would be the trigger requiring the user to have
Faith(Harumok) while it houses the Focus. 
     I'm not sure if this helped or even if it answered your question any.  I'm
kinda fuzzy on it myself.  SpiriTech just sounded like a neat idea at the time. 
Like so many other things that I've lived to regret. :)

Out of context section:

#Overall things look pretty interesting so far.

 *  Even if there are large holes in some of the areas, I'm happy to see 
 *that there are still others silly enough to write up huge bloody great 
 *realities :-)

     Thanks, guys.  Oh and 'large holes'?  Excuse me, but you can drive a
cosmverse through most of them.:)

     Oh the easy part - okay!  Well, get the rules for building stuff and. . .
     ummm. . .
     errrr. . . 
     . . . Hrumph.  Whadda ya know - they don't got none!

     Well, it looks like I'll have to use my own rules, using Weird Science as a
model.  I know, I know, calm down.  Not exactly like WS, but with the same
general concepts of power plant, et al.

STUFF:
     FIrst some basics:  everything built in the cosmverse is an object from one
and only one class.  All classes must have both A Minumum Tech Axiom and a TOU
attribute.  A Type of object 'inherets' its attributes from its 'parent' class,
and may also have additional attributes.  The 'children' of those types inheret
all the attributes of their 'parent' types and may have additional attributes. 
A child may delete or substitute inherited attributes & stuff, but at a much
greater penalty (DN or otherwise) than 'purchasing' them. [Got that? Good, now
that we all know Object-Oriented Programming, let's continue. :)]
     There could be more types of types (of types...ad nauseum), but when you
get right down to it each object is made of components.  There are the obvious
types of components e.g. control, power, housing parts, but there is also
attributes that you apply to the conceptual object - combat-rated, modular,
production possible(as is mass-production), kit-bashed etc. that would modify
non-attribute effects.  Limitations could also be assigned to objects/classes as
well as having component-level boosters & compinsators.
     There could be entire design teams, but then you start getting into co-
ordination checks and Scholar(management).
 
Vehicle - an object that moves you under its own power to another location
  Vehicle Types {example}
     Motorcycle
     Construction
     Tractor-trailer
     Cars
     Fixed-wing aircraft
     LTA aircraft
     Rotory-wing aircraft
     Space Craft
     Submarines
     Watercraft

Weapon - an object that can apply a Damage total to another object

Building - a container that doesn't move and lends it armor value to it's
contents

Tool - an object that 'adds' to the users skill level or attribute

Communicator - an object that pases information to another object

NOE - an object that is directly related to the Nameless One / Eternity (DD's,
shards, talismans, etc.)

For Example:

              CLASS           TYPE             CAR TYPE
             Vehicle           Car             Compact

Attr          Size          Passengers        Production
           Cruise Speed     Armour Add        Efficient
              Range         Cornering
              Price        Acceleration
                             Max Speed

Comp         Housing          Armour            Wheels
            Motivation       Control          
            Power Plant      Interior

Limits         ---             ---              Comfort


BUILDING IT:
so a compact car (Tech 23) would need values for
    Size
    Max Speed
    Cruise SPeed
    Range
    Price
    #Pass (incl user)
    TOU
    Axiom Level
and adds for the following:
    Acceleration
    Armor Add
    Cornering

To build said car would require the following parts:
   Housing - body
   Motivation - transmission
   Power Plant - engine
   Armour - re-enforcement & crash protection
   Controls - steering wheel & gauges
   Interior - seats, consumer electronics
   Wheels - (!) wheels   :>

The attributes that would modify things:
   Production ready - adds to the design DN, but reduces building time, Price
and one other attribute. (lets say)
   Efficient -  raises the DN for designing/building/repairing but increases
range by X.
   Comfort limitation - lowers design DN and decreases Price -  moves
interactions one level worse after X time in car.

THE ROLLS:
   Going from concept to finished product involves many things, but can be
broken down into four operations: design (A), design check (B), manufacturing
(C) & testing (D).  Dramatic skill resolution is used: if you have tried to
build something from scratch for AE 402-Aircraft Design II class - your know
that the time constraint is *very* real. :)
   That mainly relates to kit-bashing under combat conditions as how long your
'turn' will be normally depends on something other than combat rounds.  Probably
a Science- or Scholar-(Managment) total.
     When starting the project, the head honcho makes three decisions:  the
stats of the 'perfect' object, the # of steps to be taken, and the time per
flip.  It will take a minimum of X time to make all judgments.  The 'perfect'
object would become the difficulty numer by a proccess relating 'time unit' per
step, and the stats of the object.  (So the big cheese/client would have to set
realistic goals or else find out that there is no way on Earth (or in the
current cosm) to make it work.  Then he would determine how many steps they want
to take: if they'll Design&Test&Build&Test it all at the same time, they only
have to succeed at step A (standard DSR DN mods though).  The success of the co-
ordination and the scholar/sci (manag) would tell what the actual time frame
would be.

EXAMPLE:  Thomas defines the 'perfect' Widget which has a DN of 20.  Thomas
wants to take all 4 steps and says he wants to get this done and out the door in
two months.  He considers that 10 flips will be enough to get and succeed at all
four steps.  Now the calculating begins  60 days = 9  10 flips = 5 -> 9-5=4  4 =
6 days = one flip.   A managment check would let him decrease the # of time
units in a flip if he did  exccedingly well, keep it as desired or even increase
the # of time units per flip.  (The DN needs to be defined though.)  Thomas
fails his managment roll, he can take the increased time per flip and take the
consequnces (angry customers, end of the world, etc.), or he can trash the
project and start from scratch again.

    A failure at step A or 'Possible Setback' will force a complete redesign (eg
new stats) or increase the number of steps as will a 'Complication'.  A
'Critical Problem' means that the idea is flawed and will immediately force the
redesign _and_ more steps.
    By taking more steps, adding limitaions, or lowering the 'perfect' object's
stats the design DN could be lowered.  By taking more steps, the head honch can
still fail a step and not have to redesign everything, he merely goes back to
the previous step.  If a Design Test (B) failed, then its time to go back to the
drawing board (A).  Once you have succeeded with A, you can not change the base
DN, nor the time units with out trashing the whole process and spending more
time for the first two criteria (Design DN# and Time/Step#), but you can never
fail (a) and get forcefully kicked out of the design proccess.
   I haven't got a method for determining the DN's, by I haven't really thought
that far ahead yet.  I'm still trying to define the classes, objects, attribute,
& etc.

WHERE SPIRITECH FITS IN:
    The technician could invoke a few fury spirits for the power plant booster
with success levels of the Spiritech's (Faith skill + Spiritech adds)
translating through a speed push into either adds for acceleration or say,
increasing Max speed.
    He could also invoke patience spirits to improve Cornering (braking) the
same way.  Or maybe substituting wind spirits for the lift fans on the GEV
version (GEV nomally subtitutes lift fans for wheels, adds the Jump Height Attr.
and takes the Noisy Limitation)
    Forces the WL required Limitaion to be applied.

WHERE ULTRACAD FITS IN:
    By using the ULTRACAD system, the object can automaticlly get the Modular
and Production attribute and their benefits with the penalties greatly reduced
for modular, and negated for production.

WHERE WEIRD SCIENCE FITS IN:
    Lowers Min Tech Axiom by 10
    Allows for the power push to be used insted of the speed push
    Non-'standard' components (ham sandwiches, toasters, Possibility capacitors,
flux conflabulators, etc.) may be substituted for 'normal' components
    "Powers" are availble to 'install'
    Forces WL Required limitation & One-of-a-kind limitation

CONCLUSION: (?)
    Obviously this rambles a bit, is really vague, and doesn't amount to much. 
But I am refining it for my Torg v2.0b1 game.  Any one who wants to netpick is
welcome to, If you care to disscuss it - I welcome that too, but I'm not going
to get too deep into one topic and I'm not going to start number crunching for a
while.  (Yes, the metaphysics of Torg; reconnection, axioms, etc. are far too
deep for this right now.  They work for now - I'm using them - 'nuff said on my
part.)

    Phew! 22 words of a question results in 1345 words of an answer.  Hmmm. . .
Aha! A VX rating of 61.126  (Verbosity eXperienced).  Not bad, not bad . . .
