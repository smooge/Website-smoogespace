<i>Notes: Tria is involved in a campaigned Romance subplot with Father
O'Malley, Doubting Priest.  However, O'Malley has been retired (he
went insane) so the subplot may have ended.</i>

<dt><h3>Description: </h3>

<dd>A beautiful woman of Mediterranean descent, Tria has long, glossy
black hair, and deep blue eyes.  She dresses in typical Nile Egyptian
garb when at home or at the College of Mathematics but prefers
fashionable "period" outfits when she is out in public.  She has a
bewitching smile and alluring manner at all times unless she is
angered.  At formal affairs, she will be slightly subdued and will
wear the typical Egyptian sign of mourning (whatever that may be) as
she is technically still in mourning for her husband.<p>

<dt><h3>Background:</h3>

<dd>Tria was a student of Mathematics in Mobius' Ninth Empire.  Shortly
before Mobius invaded Earth, she married one of the minor deans of the
College of Mathematics.  It was an unusual romance, he being in his
late eighties, she only 20.  No one was very surprised when he died
shortly after Mobius came to Earth; many people will say (but not
openly or publically) that the old man died of exhaustion trying to
keep up with his young wife.  After a suitable period of mourning,
Tria petitioned for and was granted her late husband's position as a
lesser dean at the College.
<p>
The truth of the matter is that Tria murdered her husband when he no
longer had any secrets of mathematics to teach her.  It is not a well
kept secret that Tria has had many affairs during her marriage and
after her husband's death.  Her status however has insulated her from
the accusations, which is why she doesn't care who knows about her
libidinous actions.  Now that she has accomplished the first step in
her quest for power, she is eagerly planning her next step, attaining
the position of full dean at the College.  Her eventual goal is to
become an Overgovernor for Mobius.
<p>
Tria has made every effort to be noticed by Mobius as a competent
mathematician and loyal servant.  She accompanied the Nile's
ambassador to the United States on his efforts to create a peace
treaty between Mobius and the Delphi Council, which would have
succeeded if the ambassador hadn't been assassinated by Storm Knights.
After the ambassador's assassination, Tria took over the negotiations
and almost convinced the US delegation to sign the treaty before the
mystery man known as the Eagle presented the US delegates with
evidence of Mobius' support of Baruk Kaah's actions in the US.  Tria
managed to clear herself of the failure and still has an umblemished
record as far as the Pharoah is concerned.
<p>
During the ambassador's trip to the United States, Tria found herself
in love with someone for the first time in her life.  That person, a
Catholic priest named Patrick O'Malley, used her affections to gain
information about the Nile's actions in the Living Land and then
betrayed her feelings by assisting his Storm Knight companions in
attempting to foil the Nile's attempts to convince the US of their
peaceful intentions.  They failed though, and Tria developed an
intense hatred of the man who treated her in such a manner (the fact
that she treats all men in that manner apparently doesn't change
things.)
<p>
A few months later, while the US delegation was in the Nile to finish
the peace treaty, Father O'Malley returned to Tria's life in an
unusual manner; he was one of the Storm Knights that assassinated the
ambassador!  When O'Malley and the other Storm Knights were captured
by Mobius' forces, Tria requested that O'Malley be placed in her
custody.  Mobius, knowing of her hatred, agreed.
<p>
Tria was surprised to discover that O'Malley was finally willing to
admit that he loved her and was willing to abandon the priesthood for
her.  She almost relented, but decided that he was just trying to use
her again.  She used a special mathematical ritual to ensnare
O'Malley's mind (much like she used on her late husband) and make
certain that his love of her would remain eternal.  She, of course,
has no love for O'Malley and enjoyed parading him around as her
"captive stormer".  However, she did allow O'Malley's friends to
rescue him (without raising an alarm when she caught them in the act)
so her true feelings remain slightly in doubt.
<p>
Since then, Tria's activities are unknown.  The period of mourning for
her husband is almost over though, so she will probably be starting
her plans for acquiring full deanhood in the College soon enough.
