<i>Notes: Ptolemy is an Ayslish dwarf transformed to the Nile reality.</i>
<p>
<dl>
<dt><h3>Appearance:</h3>
 
<dd>Ptolemy is a 1.5 meter tall, stocky dwarf who wears his
beard in the Egyptian manner (long, banded, with a curl at the end)
and has shaved his head bald.  He typically dresses in Egyptian
clothing and styles.
<p>

<dt> <h3>Background:</h3>

<dd>Ptolemy (previous name unrevealed) was originally a dwarven engineer
in Aysle that was kidnapped along with numerous other dwarves by Nile
agents to work in Mobius' Weird Science laboratories.  By the time the
dwarves were rescued from their slavery, Ptolemy had trans- formed
over to the Nile reality.  During the escape, Ptolemy had his "moment
of crisis" and became a stormer.  At this time, Ptolemy's Inclination
was Good.
<p>
After returning to Aysle, Ptolemy began building a pyramid in Oxford,
saying that he felt "more comfortable" with it around.  Later, when
the pyramid was about half complete, Ptolemy hit upon the idea of
creating a flying base of operations for his Storm Knight friends and
began designing a flying apparatus that would propel the pyramid
through the sky.
<p>
Ptolemy had just finished creating a prototype Flight device when his
troubles started up.  His Storm Knight friends brought a Nile mummy to
him and asked him to hide the mummy in his pyramid while they hunted
down the Nile Overgovernor Natatiri, who had sent the mummy to Oxford
to steal a valuable eternity shard.
<p>
When Natatiri snuck into Oxford herself, looking for the mummy and the
eternity shard, she used Inclination Seduction on Ptolemy to bring him
over to the Evil side.  Ptolemy helped set up a trap for his former
friends in the pyramid but was fortunately unable to complete it
before the Storm Knights returned.
<p>
Forced to flee from his former friends, Ptolemy took off into the
night sky using his prototype Flight device, only to seemingly die
when a gunshot struck the device and it exploded over the city.
<p>
In reality, the explosion was a ruse of Ptolemy's to make certain that
no one attempted to follow him or track him down.  He slowly made his
way to the Nile Empire and has begun building another flying pyramid.
Ptolemy's former friends have not yet learned that he is still alive.
<p>
<dt><h3>Goals:</h3>
<dd>
Ptolemy's immediate goal is to complete construction of his flying
pyramid.  After that, he intends to present it to Pharaoh Mobius and
hopefully gain a position of great power from him.  He holds a mild
grudge against Natatiri, who abandonded him in Oxford when she made
her escape.  Making her look bad is a minor goal of his.
