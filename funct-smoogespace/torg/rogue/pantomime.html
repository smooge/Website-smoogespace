continual meddling, and will try to capture them for bizzare death

Baruuh Kaah.) He is much more physical and much, much less subtle than
Bozo, always trying to get things done as fast as possible.

<i>Notes: Zoob is the twin sister of both Bozo and Zobo twin sister.  Her
brothers typically underrate her abilities, usually putting her on the
sideline during important missions.  Her S.O.P. is to tease and tempt,
and then trick, a man out of what she wants.  Depending on how the
party acts, she is closest to being inclination seduced, but she may
also richochet the worst if they fail.</i>

<i>Notes: The youngest brother of the Pantomine family, Booz has
been the kid who sits back and tinkers while his brothers went off to
pop off banks. His specialty in science has been to augment people
into clownoids... loyal idiots that are tough enough to handle
stormers. He is the only one of the family who really appreciates
Zoob, and is VERY protective of her. He prefers to entertain people by
pantomine and has been known to stare people into giving them their
money.</i>

<i>Notes on Killer Clowns: Depending on the mood of the game, these
clowns can be anything from comic relief to murderous jokers (but
remember they have to have a sense of humour) Zobo is the most
murderous of them, and Booz is the most comic.  I've played them in
the past when being hit, bouncing around like toons...</i>
