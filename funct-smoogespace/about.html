<h1 align=center>What Is SmoogeSpace</h1>

<p>SmoogeSpace is a web home away from work for me, Stephen Smoogen. I use
it to put up little tidbits that I shouldnt put at my current workplace,
and to document one of my main interests in life, gaming.

<p>Welcome to my mind, and please turn out the lights when you leave. I
always forget myself, but the electric bill is getting rather large this
year.
