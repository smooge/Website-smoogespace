	    <p>
	      In a nutshell, I am a fellow who began using computers in
	      the 1980's and found like many other youth, that I was
	      better able to talk to them than my fellow human beings. I
	      am working on a longer biography, but if you are
	      interested you should read
	      the <a href="./whoami.html">older one</a>.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      Originally SmoogeSpace was a joke I had come up when I was
	      working Technical Support at Red Hat. We were reading
	      about another fawning Venture Capitalist (VC) giving a
	      talk about how the Internet was the big thing of the 21st
	      century, how companies needed to rethink themselves, and
	      the crazier the idea the more money you would make
	      somehow.
	    </p>

	    <p>
	      I joked about creating a website that would collect
	      information about Linux, the Internet, and a couple of
	      other buzzwords I cant remember now. We would then sell
	      this information via an auction method making ourselves a
	      clearing house of the best known technologies. It would be
	      called <b>SmoogeSpace</b> as that was the best branding
	      idea I could come up after such a strong epiphany.
	    </p>

	    <p>
	      The next day, I found out that my co-workers had
	      registered the site and I had to do something with it.. since they
	      had put the $100 or some such some into it.
	    </p>

	    <p>
	      I guess someday I will make that MetaWeb technology
	      clearing house.. but since the Internet Bubble has
	      thankfully broken finally.. I really dont think there are
	      going to be the fools to throw money at me there were
	      before.
