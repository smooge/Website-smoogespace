      In a nutshell, I am a fellow who began using computers in the
      1980's and found like many other youth, that I was better able to
      talk to them than my fellow human beings. I am working on a longer
      biography, but if you are interested you should read the <a
      href="./whoami.html">older one</a>.

    <p>
      While I am happily employed at <a href="http://www.redhat.com">Red
      Hat, Inc.</a>, I have found that it is always good to keep a
      resume handly for that next oppurtunity or problem.

      Originally SmoogeSpace was a joke I had come up when I was working
      Technical Support at Red Hat. We were reading about  another
      fawning Venture Capitalist (VC) giving a talk about how the
      Internet was the big thing of the 21st century, how companies
      needed to rethink themselves, and the crazier the idea the more
      money you would make somehow.
    </p>

    <p>
      I joked about creating a website that would collect information
      about Linux, the Internet, and a couple of other buzzwords I cant
      remember now. We would then sell this information via an auction
      method making ourselves a clearing house of the best known
      technologies. It would be called <b>SmoogeSpace</b> as that was
      the best branding idea I could come up after such a strong
      epiphany. 
    </p>

    <p>
      The next day, I found out that my co-workers had registered
      the site and I had to do something with it.. since they had put
      the $100 or some such some into it.
    </p>

    <p>
      I guess someday I will make that MetaWeb technology clearing
      house.. but since the Internet Bubble has thankfully broken
      finally.. I really dont think there are going to be the fools to
      throw money at me there were before.
