	I have always been of the opinion that we do not pay enough to
	the people who matter the most to our society. These are usually
	people who work for tax dollars, and get the shaft because no
	one wants to raise taxes if needed. To misquote someone I heard
	long ago, you get the society you pay for.

	<dl>
	  <dt>
	    Teachers
	  </dt>
	  <dd>
	    While we all see cases of teachers who shouldnt teach... I
	    think that if you look hard enough you will find people in
	    whatever your position is. These people are teaching the
	    future of our society, and usually work a hell of a lot of
	    hours in doing so. (All the teachers I have ever met do
	    12-14 hour days in preparing classes, dealing with
	    troublesome students, and grading homework.) If we want a
	    better world, these people are at least one third of the
	    answer.
	  </dd>

	  <dt>
	    Military Personnel
	  </dt>
	  <dd>
	    These people put there lives on the line for the freedoms
	    that you and I take for granted every day. They may be sent
	    to places that we would never want to go, and do things we
	    would never want to do because it is in our countries
	    interests.
	  </dd>

	  <dt>
	    Public Peace Officers (Police and Fire)
	  </dt>
	  <dd>
	    Again people who do a job that most of us are afraid to
	    do. While this is a difficult job, it is a two way
	    street. Every officer "on the beat" need the respect of the
	    community to do their job, but they also need to make sure
	    they deserve that respect.
	  </dd>
	</dl>

	<p>
	  There are a lot of discussions from people who feel that one side or
	  another already get paid too much. In the end, I think each of these
	  people have a very tough job, and need as much respect and help as the
	  other.
	</p>
      </dd>
      <dt>
	<a name="bigotry">Bigotry</a>
      </dt>

      <dd>
	Bigotry is an ugly disease that I think we are all inflicted
	with in some way or another. Of all the diseases I have ever had
	it is the one that I am most sick of. We fear, get angry, and
	hate each other for things that are so small in differences that
	they are truly un remarkable. I think I read somewhere that the
	genetic differences between a black person and a white person
	are 6 genes... and those genes are so varied in between white
	populations and black populations that you can't call them
	markers of superiority, inferiority, or any of the other
	buzzwords I heard growing up in this country (both North and
	South of the Mason Dixon line).

	<p>
	  In the end, we are all afraid of change and differences
	  probably at some instinctual level. However, we are more
	  afraid of admitting that we have these fears than trying to
	  get past them... so we lie, we enslave, we kill, and we make
	  up excuses that bring out all the ugliness that is human.
	</p>

	<p>
	  If you think I am laying judgement on other people... think
	  again. Most of those words are directed at myself. I
	  have thought unkind thoughts, spoken things I now wish I could
	  wash out with lye, and been a royal bigot just like the rest
	  of us in our own ways...
	</p>

	<p>
	  In the end, I just have to spend every day like the alcoholic
	  working it out and trying to not make the mistakes I made
	  before.
